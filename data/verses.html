<p>Ver. 1.<span class="emphasis bold"> In the beginning.</span>] A BEGINNING there was then, whatever Aristotle <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="a" style="display: inline; " title="Aristotle&#8217;s <i>Physic.; vide</i> Sharpei <i>Symphon., </i> p. 11, Pliny, l. i., c. 1. 2 Jo.

So true is that of a learned Italians - Philosophy seeks after truth; divinity only finds it; religion improves it. <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="b" style="display: inline; " title="Jo. Picus Mirand. ">(b)</span> {<i> Veritatem quaerit philosophia, invenit theologia,</i> &c.} But the philosopher would be yet better satisfied. He had read (say some) <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="c" style="display: inline; " title="D. Prid. <i>Cathedra.</i> ">(c)</span> this first of Genesis, and was heard to say thereupon, Well said, Sir Moses; how prove you what you have so said? {<i> Egregie dicis, domine Moses; sed quomodo probas?</i>} An ancient <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="d" style="display: inline; " title="Augustine ">(d)</span> answereth, I believe it, I need not prove it. {<i> credo, non probo</i>} Another, <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="e" style="display: inline; " title="Ambrose ">(e)</span> we believe the holy penmen before heathen wise men. {<i> piscatoribus credimus, non dialecticis</i>} A third, <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="f" style="display: inline; " title="Rupet ">(f)</span> The mysteries of the Christian religion are better understood by believing, than believed by understanding {<i> Multo melius credendo intelliguntur, quam intelligendo creduntur fidei Christianae mysteria. Abbas Tuiciensis.</i>} <i> Theologia non est argumentativa.</i> <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="g" style="display: inline; " title="Alsted. ">(g)</span> But, best of all, the apostle, &quot;Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God; so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.&quot; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="heb+11:3" translation="">Hebrews 11:3</span>] Divinity doth not use to prove her principles, whereof this is one. No, not Aristotle&#8217;s own divinity, (his <i>Metaphysics</i>, I mean) wherein he requires to be believed upon his bare word. Albeit, if Ramus may be judge, those fourteen books of his are the most idle and impious piece of sophistry that ever was set forth by any man. <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="h" style="display: inline; " title="Aristotle&#8217;s  <span class='greek-hebrew'>S&#959;&#966;&#953;&#945;</span>, <i> seu Theologia, sophistica, est, omnium quae literis unquam mandata sunt, maxime stulta, maximeque impia.</i>  - Ramus <i>in Theolog.</i> ">(h)</span> Thus, &quot;Professing themselves to be wise, they become fools.&quot; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="ro+1:22" translation="">Romans 1:22</span>] &quot;Behold, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them?&quot; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="jer+8:9" translation="">Jeremiah 8:9</span>] </p>
<p>Plato had read Moses, whatever Aristotle had done; and held truly, that the world had a beginning. So did all the philosophers that were before Aristotle, except the Chaldeans, and Hossellus Lucanus, the Pythagorean, out of whom Aristotle took his arguments, which are to be read, {<i>Physic, viii. c. 8, and ii. and l. 1. De Coelo, c. 1, and l. xii.; Metaphysics, c. 7.</i>} But it is more than probable that he taught the world&#8217;s eternity in opposition to Plato and others, who rightly concluded the world must needs have had a beginning; otherwise we could not know whether the egg or the bird, the seed or the plant, the day or the night, the light or the darkness, were first; sure it is that he held that opinion rather out of an affectation of singularity, than for any soundness of the matter or strength of argument. Himself, in his first book of <i>Topics</i>, and ninth chapter, saith that it is no more than a topical problem: he should have said a plain paradox, yea, a mere falsity. For &quot;In the beginning,&quot; the Jerusalem Targum hath &quot;In wisdom,&quot; that is, in God the Son, saith Augustine, according to <span class="scriptRef" ref="joh+1:3" translation="">John 1:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" ref="heb+1:2" translation="">Hebrews 1:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" ref="col+1:16" translation="">Colossians 1:16</span>. And indeed God created all things by his Son Christ; not as by a concreating cause, but as by his own essential Wisdom. [<span class="scriptRef" ref="1co+1:24" translation="">1 Corinthians 1:24</span><i>; </i><span class="scriptRef" ref="pr+1:20" translation="">Proverbs 1:20</span><i>; </i><span class="scriptRef" ref="pr+8:1" translation="">Proverbs 8:1</span>] And of this mystery and appellation some suppose the heathens had some traditional knowledge; for aa Christ, the Wisdom of the Father, was eternally and ineffably begotten in the divine essence, so they worshipped a goddess whom they called the goddess of wisdom, and feigned that she was begotten by Jupiter of his own brain; and they called her  <span class="greek-hebrew">A&#952;&#951;&#957;&#951;</span>, which word is much like in sound with the Hebrew <i>Adonai</i>, as a reverend man <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="i" style="display: inline; " title="Mr Manton upon Jude. ">(i)</span> hath well observed. </p>
<p><span class="emphasis bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="emphasis bold">God created.</span>] Heb. <i>Dii creavit.</i> {<i>Plural subject &quot;Dii&quot;</i> (Gods) singular verb <i>&quot;creavit&quot;</i> . Editor.} The Mystery of the blessed Trinity, called by Elihu, [<span class="scriptRef" ref="job+35:10" translation="">Job 35:10</span>] <i>Eloah Gnoscai</i>, &quot;God my Makers&quot;; and by David, [<span class="scriptRef" ref="ps+149:1" translation="">Psalms 149:1</span>] &quot;The Makers of Israel,&quot; and &quot;Remember thy Creators,&quot; saith Solomon. [<span class="scriptRef" ref="ec+12:1" translation="">Ecclesiastes 12:1</span>] To the same sense, sweetly sounds the Haphtera, or portion of Scripture which is read by the Jews, <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="j" style="display: inline; " title="Moses was read every Sabbath, [<span class='scriptRef' ref='ac+15:11' translation=''>Acts 15:11</span>] with a lecture out of the prophets, [<span class='scriptRef' ref='ac+13:15' translation=''>Acts 13:15</span>] ">(j)</span> together with this of Moses, viz., <span class="scriptRef" ref="isa+42:5" translation="">Isaiah 42:5</span>. And that of the psalmist, [<span class="scriptRef" ref="ps+33:6" translation="">Psalms 33:6</span>] &quot;By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath [or spirit] of his mouth&quot;: that is, God the Father, by the Son, through the Holy Ghost, created all. This Trismegist, <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="k" style="display: inline; " title=" <span class='greek-hebrew'>&#951;&#954;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#949; &#948;&#949; &#960;&#961;&#959; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#966;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#969;</span> - Suidas.  <span class='greek-hebrew'>&#964;&#961;&#953;&#962; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, in Poemandro. <i> Nam haec propria est Hebraei verbi significatio.</i> <i>Jun.</i> ">(k)</span> an ancient Egyptian (for he flourished before Pharaoh), acknowledged, and thence had his name. The Hebrews also of old were no strangers to this mystery, though their posterity understood it not. Rabbi Solomon Jarchi, writing on that, [<span class="scriptRef" ref="so+1:11" translation="">Song of Solomon 1:11</span>] &quot;We will make,&quot; &c., interprets it, &quot;I and my judgment hall.&quot; Now a judgment hall in Israel consisted of three at least, which in their close manner of speech, they applied to God, who is Three in one, and One in three. </p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon, the son of Johai, brings a place out of Rabbi Ibba, on <span class="scriptRef" ref="de+6:4" translation="">Deuteronomy 6:4</span>, &quot;Jehovah Elohenu, Jehovah Echad, &#8216;The Lord our God is one Lord.&#8217;&quot; Here the first Jehovah, saith he, is God the Father, <i>Elohenu</i>, the Son (who is fitly called <i>our God</i>, because he assumed our nature, as is well observed by Galatinus), the third <i>Jehovah</i> is God the Holy Ghost. <i>Echad,</i> one, showeth the unity of essence in this plurality of persons; wherefore, saith Luther, doth not Moses begin thus, &quot;In the beginning, God said, Let there be a heaven, and earth,&quot; but because he would set forth the three persons in order; the Father, when he saith, God <i>created; </i> the Son, when he saith, God said; and the Holy Ghost, when he saith, <i>God saw the light that it was good?</i> </p>
<p><span class="emphasis bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="emphasis bold">Created.</span>] Made all things of nothing, in a most marvellous and magnificent manner, as the word signifieth. This Plato doubts of, Aristotle denies, Galen derides as a thing impossible, <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="l" style="display: inline; " title="<i> Irridet Galenus Mosen eo quod dicat Deum ex nulla praeexistente materia condidisse mundum.</i>  - <i>Buch.</i> ">(l)</span> because, with Nicodemus, he cannot conceive how these things can be. &quot;The natural man,&quot; the mere animal, {<span class="greek-hebrew">Q&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span><i>, </i><span class="scriptRef" ref="1co+2:14" translation="">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>} whose reason is not elevated by religion, &quot;pereeiveth not these things of the Spirit of God: they are foolishness unto him.&quot; The cock on the dunghill meddles not with these matters. Well might St Paul tell the men of Athens, [<span class="scriptRef" ref="ac+17:23-24" translation="">Acts 17:23-24</span>] (and yet Athens was the Greece of Greece,  <span class="greek-hebrew">E&#955;&#955;&#945;&#962; E&#955;&#955;&#945;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="m" style="display: inline; " title="Athenaeus. ">(m)</span> and had in it the most mercurial wits in the world), that God, &quot;that made all things of nothing,&quot; was to them the &quot;unknown God&quot;: and Lactantius fitly saith of Plato (who yet merited the style of <i>Divine</i> amongst them), that he dreamed of God, rather than had any true knowledge of him. <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="n" style="display: inline; " title="<i> Somniaverat Deum, non cognoverat.</i>  - <i>Instit., </i> l. v. c. l4.

Atheists of old scorned at the work of creation; and asked, <i>&quot;Quibus machinis,&quot;</i> with what tools, engines, ladders, scaffolds, did the Lord set up this mighty frame? But, &quot;Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed&quot; (set in joint,  <span class="greek-hebrew">&#958;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#950;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#951;&#945;&#953;</span>, <span class="scriptRef" ref="heb+11:3" translation="">Hebrews 11:3</span>, the word signifieth, as all the members of the body are tied together by several ligaments), &quot;by the word of God,&quot; without either tool or toil. [<span class="scriptRef" ref="isa+40:28" translation="">Isaiah 40:28</span>] He not only formed and made, but created all by the word of his power: see all these ascribed unto him in <span class="scriptRef" ref="isa+43:7" translation="">Isaiah 43:7</span>. There were four errors, saith a late learned man, <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="o" style="display: inline; " title="Zanchi. ">(o)</span> about the creation: some affirmed that the world was eternal; some that it had a material beginning, and was made of something; some held two beginners of things: that one beginner made things incorruptible, and another made things corruptible. Lastly, some said God made the superior creatures himself, and the inferior by angels. This very first verse of the Bible confutes all four. <i>In the beginning,</i> shows the world not to be eternal. <i>Created,</i> notes that it was made of nothing. <i>The heaven and the earth,</i> shows that God was the only beginner of all creatures. <i>God</i> created all: this excludes the angels. In the <i>government</i> of the world, we grant they have a great stroke. [<span class="scriptRef" ref="eze+1:5-6" translation="">Ezekiel 1:5-6</span><i>; </i><span class="scriptRef" ref="da+10:1-21" translation="">Daniel 10:1-21</span><i>; </i><span class="scriptRef" ref="da+11:1-45" translation="">Daniel 11:1-45</span>] Not so in the <i>making</i> of the world, wherein God was alone, and by himself. [<span class="scriptRef" ref="isa+44:24" translation="">Isaiah 44:24</span>] And, lest any should imagine otherwise, the creation of angels is not so much as mentioned by Moses, unless it be tacitly intimated in these words - &quot;The heavens and the earth&quot;; <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="p" style="display: inline; " title=" <span class='greek-hebrew'>K&#959;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#956;&#949;&#957; &#949;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#945; &#949;&#958; &#959;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#951;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#966;&#965;&#949;&#969;&#957;</span> - Aristotle, <i>De Mundo</i>, c. 2. Yates&#8217;s <i>Model of Divinity.</i> ">(p)</span> &quot;The world and all the things that are therein&quot;; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="ac+17:24" translation="">Acts 17:24</span>] &quot;Things visible and invisible&quot;; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="col+1:16" translation="">Colossians 1:16</span>] &quot;whether they be thrones or dominions,&quot; &c., called elsewhere &quot;angels of heaven&quot;; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="mt+24:26" translation="">Matthew 24:26</span><i>; </i><span class="scriptRef" ref="ga+1:8" translation="">Galatians 1:8</span>] because, probably, created with, and in the highest heaven, as Christ&#8217;s soul was created with, and in his body, in the Virgin&#8217;s womb, the self-same moment. The highest heaven, and the angels were of necessity, say some, to be created the first instant, that they might have their perfection of matter and form together; otherwise they should be corruptible. For whatsoever is of a pre-existent matter is resolvable, and subject to corruption; but that which is immediately of nothing is perfectly composed, hath no other change, but by the same hand to return to nothing again. </p>
<p>Ques. But if this were the heaven, what was the earth here mentioned? </p>

<p>The Cabbalists observe that there are in this first verse of the Holy Bible six <i>Alephs:</i> and therehence they conclude, that the world shall last six thousand years. But they may be therein as far out as that wise man <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="q" style="display: inline; " title="Bucholcer., <i>Chronol.</i> ">(q)</span> was who, A.D. 1533, affirmed that the world would be at an end that very year, in the month of October, and that he pretended to gather out of those words, <i> Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum:</i> and again those, <i> Videbunt in quem transfixerunt.</i> So some <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="r" style="display: inline; " title="Alsted., <i>Chronol.</i>">(r)</span> since that, but little wiser, have foretold as much concerning the year of grace 1657, from those words <i> mundi conflagratio; </i> and because the universal flood fell out in the year of the world 1657. According to these groundless conjectures, confuted already by time, some have argued, that because Solomon&#8217;s temple was finished in the year of the world three thousand, therefore the spiritual temple shall be consummated in three thousand more. This reckoning comes up to that of the Cabbalists above mentioned; and to that known prophecy of Elias (but not the Tishbite), that as there were two thousand years, <i> plus minus,</i> before the law, and two thousand under the law, so there are to be two thousand under the gospel. </p>

But far be it from us to conceive of God as a bodily substance, to think him like unto us, as we are very apt to do. God made man in his own image; and men, of the other side, <i>quasi ad hostimentum</i>, would make God after their image. <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="j" style="display: inline; " title="Molinaeus. <i>De Cogn.

Wherefore else hath God given us a reasonable soul, and a Sabbath day, and a countenance bent upward, and, as they say, <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="a" style="display: inline; " title="Bodin. <i>Theat. Naturae.</i> ">(a)</span> peculiar nerves in the eyes, to pull them up toward the seat of their rest? Besides a nature carried with delight after plays, pageants, masks, strange shows, and rare sights, which oft are sinful or vain, or, at best, imperfect and unsatisfactory? Surely those that &quot;regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, God shall destroy, and not build them up&quot;; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="ps+28:5" translation="">Psalms 28:5</span>] which to prevent, good is the counsel of the prophet Amos; and that upon this very ground, &quot;Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel: for lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,&quot; &c. [<span class="scriptRef" ref="am+4:12-13" translation="">Amos 4:12-13</span>] When he had made man, he made an end of making anything more, because he meant to rest in man, to delight in him, to communicate himself unto him, and to be enjoyed by him throughout all eternity. And notwithstanding the fall, he hath &quot;found a ransom,&quot; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="job+33:24" translation="">Job 33:24</span>] and &quot;creating us in Christ Jesus unto good works,&quot; [<span class="scriptRef" ref="eph+2:10" translation="">Ephesians 2:10</span>] he &quot;rejoiceth over&quot; his new workmanship &quot;with joy&quot;; yea, he &quot;rests in his love,&quot; and wilt seek no further [<span class="scriptRef" ref="zep+3:17" translation="">Zephaniah 3:17</span>] But what a mouth of madness did Alfonso <span class="bible_footnote alt_foreground_dark bold" id="b" style="display: inline; " title="Roderit. <i>Santii. Hist. Hisp.</i> p. 4. c. 5. <i>ex antiq. Annanlib.</i>">(b)</span> the Wise open, when he said openly, that if he had been of God&#8217;s counsel at the creation, some things should have been better made and marshalled! Prodigious blasphemy! </p>
