<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 1  </p>
<p> This chapter contains an account of the creation of the universe, and all things in it; asserts the creation of the heaven and earth in general, and describes the state and condition of the earth in its first production, Genesis 1:1   and then proceeds to declare the work of each of the six days of creation, and to give an account of light, its separation from darkness and the names of both, the work of the first day, Genesis 1:3   of the firmament, its use and name, the work of the second day, Genesis 1:6   of the appearance of the earth, and the production of grass, herbs, and trees in the earth, the work of the third day, Genesis 1:9   of the sun, moon, and stars, their situation, and use, the work of the fourth day, Genesis 1:14   of the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea, the work of the fifth day, Genesis 1:19   of all kinds of cattle, and beasts, and creeping things, Genesis 1:24   and then of man, created male and female, after the image of God, having a grant of dominion over the rest of the creatures, the fruit of divine consultation, Genesis 1:26   and of a provision of food for man and beast, Genesis 1:29 . And the chapter is concluded with a survey God took of all his works, and his approbation of them; all which were the work of the sixth day, and closes the account of the creation in that space of time, Genesis 1:31 . </p>

<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 1:1" display="now" /><b>Gen 1:1</b></p>


<p>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  By the heaven some understand the supreme heaven, the heaven of heavens, the habitation of God, and of the holy angels; and this being made perfect at once, no mention is after made of it, as of the earth; and it is supposed that the angels were at this time created, since they were present at the laying of the foundation of the earth, Job 38:6   but rather the lower and visible heavens are meant, at least are not excluded, that is, the substance of them; as yet being imperfect and unadorned; the expanse not yet made, or the ether and air not yet stretched out; nor any light placed in them, or adorned with the sun, moon, and stars: so the earth is to be understood, not of that properly so called, as separated from the waters, that is, the dry land afterwards made to appear; but the whole mass of earth and water before their separation, and when in their unformed and unadorned state, described in the next verse: in short, these words represent the visible heavens and the terraqueous globe, in their chaotic state, as they were first brought into being by almighty power. The &#1492;   prefixed to both words is, as Aben Ezra observes, expressive of notification or demonstration, as pointing at &quot;those&quot; heavens, and &quot;this earth&quot;; and shows that things visible are here spoken of, whatever is above us, or below us to be seen: for in the Arabic language, as he also observes, the word for &quot;heaven&quot;, comes from one which signifies high or aboveF1&quot;altus fuit, eminuit&quot;, Golius, col. 1219. ; as that for &quot;earth&quot; from one that signifies low and beneath, or underF2&quot;quicquid humile, inferum et depressum&quot; ib. col. 70. Hottinger. Smegma Orient. c. 5. p. 70. & Thesaur. Philolog. l. 1. c. 2. p. 234. . Now it was the matter or substance of these that was first created; for the word &#1488;&#1514;   set before them signifies substance, as both Aben Ezra andF3Sepher Shorash. rad. &#1488;&#1514; .  Kimchi affirm. MaimonidesF4Moreh Nevochim, par. 2. c. 30. p. 275, 276.  observes, that this particle, according to their wise men, is the same as &quot;with&quot;; and then the sense is, God created with the heavens whatsoever are in the heavens, and with the earth whatsoever are in the earth; that is, the substance of all things in them; or all things in them were seminally together: for so he illustrates it by an husbandman sowing seeds of divers kinds in the earth, at one and the same time; some of which come up after one day, and some after two days, and some after three days, though all sown together. These are said to be &quot;created&quot;, that is, to be made out of nothing; for what pre-existent matter to this chaos could there be out of which they could be formed? And the apostle says, &quot;through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear&quot;, Hebrews 11:3 . And though this word is sometimes used, and even in this chapter, of the production of creatures out of pre-existent matter, as in Genesis 1:21   yet, as Nachmanides observes, there is not in the holy language any word but this here used, by which is signified the bringing anything into being out of nothing; and many of the Jewish interpreters, as Aben Ezra, understand by creation here, a production of something into being out of nothing; and Kimchi saysF5Ut supra. (Sepher Shorash.) rad. &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;    that creation is a making some new thing, and a bringing something out of nothing: and it deserves notice, that this word is only used of God; and creation must be the work of God, for none but an almighty power could produce something out of nothing. The word used is Elohim&#246;, which some derive from another, which signifies power, creation being an act of almighty power: but it is rather to be derived from the root in the Arabic language, which signifies to worshipF6&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;   &quot;coluit, unde&quot; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;   &quot;numen colendum&quot;, Schultens in Job. i. 1. Golius, col. 144. Hottinger. Smegma, p. 120. , God being the object of all religious worship and adoration; and very properly does Moses make use of this appellation here, to teach us, that he who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth is the sole object of worship; as he was of the worship of the Jewish nation, at the head of which Moses was. It is in the plural number, and being joined to a verb of the singular, is thought by many to be designed to point unto us the mystery of a plurality, or trinity of persons in the unity of the divine essence: but whether or no this is sufficient to support that doctrine, which is to be established without it; yet there is no doubt to be made, that all the three Persons in the Godhead were concerned in the creation of all things, see Psalm 33:6 . The Heathen poet Orpheus has a notion somewhat similar to this, who writes, that all things were made by one Godhead of three names, and that this God is all thingsF7See the Universal History, vol. 1. p. 33. : and now all these things, the heaven and the earth, were made by God &quot;in the beginning&quot;, either in the beginning of time, or when time began, as it did with the creatures, it being nothing but the measure of a creature's duration, and therefore could not be until such existed; or as Jarchi interprets it, in the beginning of the creation, when God first began to create; and is best explained by our Lord, &quot;the beginning of the creation which God created&quot;, Mark 13:19   and the sense is, either that as soon as God created, or the first he did create were the heavens and the earth; to which agrees the Arabic version; not anything was created before them: or in connection with the following words, thus, &quot;when first&quot;, or &quot;in the beginning&quot;, when &quot;God created the heavens and the earth&quot;, then &quot;the earth was without form&quot;, &cF8So Vatablus. . The Jerusalem Targum renders it, &quot;in wisdom God created&quot;; see Proverbs 3:19   and some of the ancients have interpreted it of the wisdom of God, the Logos and Son of God. From hence we learn, that the world was not eternal, either as to the matter or form of it, as Aristotle, and some other philosophers, have asserted, but had a beginning; and that its being is not owing to the fortuitous motion and conjunction of atoms, but to the power and wisdom of God, the first cause and sole author of all things; and that there was not any thing created before the heaven and the earth were: hence those phrases, before the foundation of the world, and before the world began, &c. are expressive of eternity: this utterly destroys the notion of the pre-existence of the souls of men, or of the soul of the Messiah: false therefore is what the Jews sayF9Targum Jon. & Jerus. in Gen. iii. 24. T. Bab. Pesachim, fol. 54. 1. & Nedarim, fol. 39. 2. , that paradise, the righteous, Israel, Jerusalem, &c. were created before the world; unless they mean, that these were foreordained by God to be, which perhaps is their sense. </p>

<p>And the earth was without form, and void ,.... It was not in the form it now is, otherwise it must have a form, as all matter has; it was a fluid matter, the watery parts were not separated from the earthy ones; it was not put into the form of a terraqueous globe it is now, the sea apart, and the earth by itself, but were mixed and blended together; it was, as both the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase it, a waste and desert, empty and destitute of both men and beasts; and it may be added, of fishes and fowls, and also of trees, herbs, and plants. It was, as OvidF11&quot;Quem dixere chaos, rudis indigestaque moles&quot;, Ovid Metamorph. l. 1. Fab. 1.  calls it, a chaos and an indigested mass of matter; and HesiodF12   &#951;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#956;&#949;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#967;&#945;&#959;&#962;  &c. Hesiodi Theogonia.  makes a chaos first to exist, and then the wide extended earth, and so OrpheusF13Orphei Argonautica, ver. 12. , and others; and this is agreeably to the notion of various nations. The Chinese make a chaos to be the beginning of all things, out of which the immaterial being (God) made all things that consist of matter, which they distinguish into parts they call Yin and Yang, the one signifying hidden or imperfect, the other open or perfectF14Martin. Sinic. Hist. l. 1. p. 5. : and so the Egyptians, according to Diodorus SiculusF15Bibliothec. l. 1. p. 7. , whose opinion he is supposed to give, thought the system of the universe had but one form; the heaven and earth, and the nature of them, being mixed and blended together, until by degrees they separated and obtained the form they now have: and the Phoenicians, as SanchoniathoF16Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 2. c. 10. p. 33.  relates, supposed the principle of the universe to be a dark and windy air, or the blast of a dark air, and a turbid chaos surrounded with darkness, as follows, </p>
<p> and darkness was upon the face of the deep : the whole fluid mass of earth and water mixed together. This abyss is explained by waters in the next clause, which seem to be uppermost; and this was all a dark turbid chaos, as before expressed, without any light or motion, till an agitation was made by the Spirit, as is next observed: </p>
<p> and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters , which covered the earth, Psalm 104:6   the earthy particles being heaviest sunk lower, and the waters being lighter rose up above the others: hence ThalesF17Laert. in Vita Thaletis, p. 18. Cicero do Natura Deorum, l. 1.  the philosopher makes water to be the beginning of all things, as do the Indian BrahmansF18Strabo. Geograph. l. 15. p. 491. : and AristotleF19Metaphysic. l. 1. c. 3.  himself owns that this was the most ancient opinion concerning the origin of the universe, and observes, that it was not only the opinion of Thales, but of those that were the most remote from the then present generation in which he lived, and of those that first wrote on divine things; and it is frequent in Hesiod and Homer to make Oceanus, or the ocean, with Tethys, to be the parents of generation: and so the Scriptures represent the original earth as standing out of the water, and consisting of it, 2 Peter 3:5   and upon the surface of these waters, before they were drained off the earth, &quot;the Spirit of God moved&quot;; which is to be understood not of a wind, as Onkelos, Aben Ezra, and many Jewish writers, as well as Christians, interpret it; since the air, which the wind is a motion of, was not made until the second day. The Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem call it the spirit of mercies; and by it is meant the Spirit of the Messiah, as many Jewish writersF20Zohar in Gen. fol. 107. 3. and fol. 128. 3. Bereshit Rabba, fol. 2. 4. and 6. 3. Vajikra Rabba, sect. 14. fol. 156. 4. Baal Hatturim in loc. Caphtor Uperah, fol. 113. 2.  call him; that is, the third Person in the blessed Trinity, who was concerned in the creation of all things, as in the garnishing of the heavens, so in bringing the confused matter of the earth and water into form and order; see Job 26:13 . This same Spirit &quot;moved&quot; or broodedF21&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1508;&#1514;   &quot;incubabat&quot;, Junius, Tremellius, Piscator, &quot;as a dove on her young&quot;, T. Bab. Chagigah, fol. 15. 1.  upon the face of the waters, to impregnate them, as an hen upon eggs to hatch them, so he to separate the parts which were mixed together, and give them a quickening virtue to produce living creatures in them. This sense and idea of the word are finely expressed by our poetF23----and, with mighty wings outspread, Dovelike satst brooding on the vast abyss, And mad'st it pregnant.---- Milton's Paradise Lost, B. 1. l. 20, 21, 22. The same sentiment is in B. 7. l. 234, 235. . Some traces of this appear in the    &#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;  or mind of Anaxagoras, which when all things were mixed together came and set them in orderF24Laert. in Vita Anaxagor. p. 91. Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 10. c. 14. p. 504. ; and the &quot;mens&quot; of Thales he calls God, which formed all things out of waterF25Cicero de Nat. Deorum, l. 1. Lactant, de falsa Relig. l. 1. c. 5. ; and the &quot;spiritus intus alit&quot;, &c. of Virgil; and with this agrees what Hermes says, that there was an infinite darkness in the abyss or deep, and water, and a small intelligent spirit, endued with a divine power, were in the chaosF26Apud Drusium in loc. : and perhaps from hence is the mundane egg, or egg of OrpheusF1Hymn.    &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957; , ver. 1, 2. : or the firstborn or first laid egg, out of which all things were formed; and which he borrowed from the Egyptians and Phoenicians, and they perhaps from the Jews, and which was reckoned by them a resemblance of the world. The Egyptians had a deity they called Cneph, out of whose mouth went forth an egg, which they interpreted of the worldF2Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 3. c. 11. p. 115. : and the Zophasemin of the Phoenicians, which were heavenly birds, were, according to SanchoniathoF3Apud Ib. l. 2. c. 10. p. 33. , of the form of an egg; and in the rites of Bacchus they worshipped an egg, as being an image of the world, as MacrobiusF4Saturnal. l. 7. c. 16.  says; and therefore he thought the question, whether an hen or an egg was oldest, was of some moment, and deserved consideration: and the Chinese sayF5Martin. Sinic. Hist. l. 1. p. 3, 4. , that the first man was produced out of the chaos as from an egg, the shell of which formed the heavens, the white the air, and the yolk the earth; and to this incubation of the spirit, or wind, as some would have it, is owing the windy egg of AristophanesF6In Avibus. . (Thomas Chamlers (1780-1847) in 1814 was the first to purpose that there is a gap between verse 1 and 2. Into this gap he places a pre-Adamic age, about which the scriptures say nothing. Some great catastrophe took place, which left the earth &quot;without form and void&quot; or ruined, in which state it remained for as many years as the geologist required.F7Ian Taylor, p. 363, 364, &quot;In the Minds of Men&quot;, 1984, TEF Publishing, P.O. Box 5015, Stn. F, Toronto, Canada.  This speculation has been popularised by the 1917 Scofield Reference Bible. However, the numerous rock layers that are the supposed proof for these ages, were mainly laid down by Noah's flood. In Exodus 20:11   we read of a literal six day creation. No gaps, not even for one minute, otherwise these would not be six normal days. Also, in Romans 5:12   we read that death is the result of Adam's sin. Because the rock layers display death on a grand scale, they could not have existed before the fall of Adam. There is no direct evidence that the earth is much older than six thousand years. However, we have the direct eyewitness report of God himself that he made everything in six days. Tracing back through the biblical genealogies we can determine the age of the universe to be about six thousand years with an error of not more than two per cent. </p>

<p>And God said ,.... This phrase is used, nine times in this account of the creation; it is admired by Longinus the Heathen in his treatise &quot;of the Sublime&quot;, as a noble instance of it; and it is most beautifully paraphrased and explained in Psalm 33:6   as expressive of the will, power, authority, and efficacy of the divine Being; whose word is clothed with power, and who can do, and does whatever he will, and as soon as he pleases; his orders are always obeyed. Perhaps the divine Person speaking here is the Logos or Word of God, which was in the beginning with God, and was God, and who himself is the light that lightens every creature. The words spoke were, </p>
<p> let there be light, and there was light : it at once appeared; &quot;God commanded light to shine out of darkness&quot;; as the apostle says, 2 Corinthians 4:6   this was the first thing made out of the dark chaos; as in the new creation, or work of grace in the heart, light is the first thing produced there: what this light was is not easy to say. Some of the Jewish Rabbins, and also some Christian writers, think the angels are designed by it, which is not at all probable, as the ends and use of this light show: others of them are of opinion, that it is the same with the sun, of which a repetition is made on the fourth day, because of its use and efficacy to the earth, and its plants; but others more rightly take it to be different from the sun, and a more glimmering light, which afterwards was gathered into and perfected in the body of the sunF6Vid. Menasseh ben Israel conciliator in Gen. qu. 2. . It is the opinion of ZanchiusF7De Operibus Dei, par. 3. l. 1. c. 2. col. 239. and l. 2. c. 1. , and which is approved of by our countryman, Mr. FullerF8Miscell. Sacr. l. 1. c. 12. , that it was a lucid body, or a small lucid cloud, which by its circular motion from east to west made day and nightF9Milton seems to be of the same mind:----- -----and forthwith light. Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure, Sprung from the deep, and from her native east To journey thro' the airy gloom began, Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle Sojourned the while.----- Paradise Lost, B. 7. l. 243, &c. ; perhaps somewhat like the cloudy pillar of fire that guided the Israelites in the wilderness, and had no doubt heat as well as light; and which two indeed, more or less, go together; and of such fiery particles this body may well be thought to consist. The word &quot;Ur&quot; signifies both fire and light. </p>

<p>And God saw the light, that it was good ,.... Very pleasant and delightful, useful and beneficial; that is, he foresaw it would be good, of great service, as PicherellusF11In Cosmopoeiam, p. 267.  interprets it; for as yet there were no inhabitants of the earth to receive any advantage by it; see Ecclesiastes 11:7   besides, it was doubtless good to answer some present purposes, to prepare for the work of the two following days, before the great luminary was formed; as to dispel the darkness of heaven, and that which covered the deep; to rarefy, exhale, and draw up the lighter parts of the chaos, in order to form the wide extended ether, the expanded air, and the surrounding atmosphere, while the Spirit of God was agitating the waters, and separating them from the earthy parts; and which also might serve to unite and harden those which were to form the dry land, and also to warm that when it appeared, that it might bring forth grass, herbs, and fruit trees: </p>
<p> and God divided the light from the darkness : by which it should seem that they were mixed together, the particles of light and darkness; but &quot;by what way is the light parted&quot;, severed and divided from darkness, is a question put to men by the Lord himself, who only can answer it, Job 38:24   he has so divided one from the other that they are not together at the same place and time; when light is in one hemisphere, darkness is in the otherF12Milton in the place above referred to says, it was divided by the hemisphere. Paradise Lost, B. 7. l. 243, &c. ; and the one by certain constant revolutions is made to succeed the other; and by the motion of the one, the other gives way; as well as also God has divided and distinguished them by calling them by different names, as Aben Ezra, and is what next follows: </p>
<h2 pb_toc="index">1:5</h2>
<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 1:5" display="now" /><b>Gen 1:5</b></p>


<p>And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night ,.... Either by the circulating motion of the above body of light, or by the rotation of the chaos on its own axis towards it, in the space of twenty four hours there was a vicissitude of light and darkness; just as there is now by the like motion either of the sun, or of the earth; and which after this appellation God has given, we call the one, day, and the other, night: </p>
<p> and the evening and the morning were the first day : the evening, the first part of the night, or darkness, put for the whole night, which might be about the space of twelve hours; and the morning, which was the first part of the day, or light, put also for the whole, which made the same space, and both together one natural day, consisting of twenty four hours; what Daniel calls an &quot;evening morning&quot;, Daniel 8:26   and the apostle    &#957;&#965;&#967;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; , a &quot;night day&quot;, 2 Corinthians 11:25 . Thales being asked which was first made, the night or the day, answered, the night was before one dayF13Laert. in Vita Thaletis. p. 24. . The Jews begin their day from the preceding evening; so many other nations: the Athenians used to reckon their day from sun setting to sun settingF14Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 77. ; the Romans from the middle of the night, to the middle of the night following, as GelliusF15Noct. Attic. l. 3. c. 2.  relates; and TacitusF16De Mor. German. c. 11.  reports of the ancient Germans, that they used to compute not the number of days, but of nights, reckoning that the night led the day. CaesarF17Commentar. l. 6. p. 141.  observes of the ancient Druids in Britain, that they counted time not by the number of days, but nights; and observed birthdays, and the beginnings of months and years, so as that the day followed the night; and we have some traces of this still among us, as when we say this day se'nnight, or this day fortnight. This first day of the creation, according to James Capellus, was the eighteenth of April; but, according to Bishop Usher, the twenty third of October; the one beginning the creation in the spring, the other in autumn. It is a notion of Mr. Whiston's, that the six days of the creation were equal to six years, a day and a year being one and the same thing before the fall of man, when the diurnal rotation of the earth about its axis, as he thinks, began; and in agreement with this, very remarkable is the doctrine Empedocles taught, that when mankind sprung originally from the earth, the length of the day, by reason of the slowness of the sun's motion, was equal to ten of our present monthsF18Vid. Universal History, vol. 1. p. 79. . The Hebrew word &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; , &quot;Ereb&quot;, rendered &quot;evening&quot;, is retained by some of the Greek poets, as by HesiodF19   &#949;&#954; &#967;&#945;&#949;&#959;&#962; &#948;'&#949;&#961;&#949;&#946;&#959;&#962; , &c. Hesiod. Theogonia. , who says, out of the &quot;chaos&quot; came &quot;Erebus&quot;, and black night, and out of the night ether and the day; and AristophanesF20   &#967;&#945;&#959;&#962; &#951;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#957;&#965;&#958; &#949;&#961;&#949;&#946;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#949; &#956;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#957;  &c. Aristophanes in Avibus. , whose words are, </p>
<p> chaos, night, and black &quot;Erebus&quot; were first, and wide Tartarus, but there were neither earth, air, nor heaven, but in the infinite bosom of Erebus, black winged night first brought forth a windy egg, &c. And OrpheusF21Hymn. 2. ver. 2.  makes night to be the beginning of all things. (Hugh Miller (1802-1856) was the first person to popularise the &quot;Day-Age&quot; theory. In his book, &quot;Testimony of the Rocks&quot;, that was published in the year after his untimely death, he speculated that that the days were really long ages. He held that Noah's flood was a local flood and the rock layers were laid down long periods of time.F22Ian Taylor, p. 360-362, &quot;In the Minds of Men&quot;, 1984, TEV Publishing, P.O.

These are the stories in the heavens the Scriptures speak of, Amos 9:6   and the air is divided by philosophers into higher, middle, and lower regions: and so the Targum of Jonathan places this firmament or expanse between the extremities of the heaven, and the waters of the ocean. The word in the Syriac language has the sense of binding and compressingF24Vid. Castell. Lex. col. 3647. Fuller. Miscell. Sacr. l. 1. c. 6. ; and so it is used in the Syriac version of Luke 6:38   and may denote the power of the air when formed in compressing the chaos, and dividing and separating the parts of it; and which it now has in compressing the earth, and the several parts that are in it, and by its compression preserves them and retains them in their proper placesF25Vid.

By a word speaking, commanding it into being, producing it out of the chaos, and spreading it in that vast space between the heaven of heavens and our earthF26------and God made The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, Transparent, elemental air, diffused In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great round.------ Milton, Paradise Lost, B. 7. l. 263, &c. , </p>
<p> And divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament ; the lower part of it, the atmosphere above, which are the clouds full of water, from whence rain descends upon the earth; and which divided between them and those that were left on the earth, and so under it, not yet gathered into one place; as it now does between the clouds of heaven and the waters of the sea. Though Mr. GregoryF1Notes and Observations, &c. c. 23. p. 110, &c.  is of opinion, that an abyss of waters above the most supreme orb is here meant; or a great deep between the heavens and the heaven of heavens, where, as in storehouses, the depth is laid up; and God has his treasures of snow, hail, and rain, and from whence he brought out the waters which drowned the world at the universal deluge. Others suppose the waters above to be the crystalline heaven, which for its clearness resembles water; and which MiltonF2Ibid. l. 291.  calls the &quot;crystalline ocean&quot;, </p>

<p> and the evening; and the morning were the second day ; these together made up the space of twenty four hours, which was another natural day; the body of light, created on the first day, having again moved round the chaos in that space of time; or else the chaos had turned round on its own axis in that time, which revolution produced a second day; and which, according to Capellus, was the nineteenth of April, and according to Bishop Usher the twenty fourth of October. It is an observation that everyone may make, that the phrase, </p>
<p> and God saw that it was good , is not used at the close of this day's work, as of the rest: the reason some Jewish writers give is, because the angels fell on this day; but it is a much better which Jarchi gives, and that is, because the work of the waters was not finished; it was begun on the second day, and perfected on the thirdF4Vid.

<p> the herb yielding seed ;  this is distinct from the former; that denotes herbage in general, which grows up of itself without being sown or manured, and is the food of beasts; this in particular, herbs and plants for the use of man, which yield a seed which either falling from it sows itself again, or is taken from it and sown on purpose to reproduce it, being useful or delightful: </p>

<p>And God made two great lights ,.... This was his own work which he himself did, and not by another; and may be particularly observed to express the folly of idolaters in worshipping these luminaries which were the creations of God, and were placed by him in the heaven to serve some purposes on earth beneficial to men, but not to be worshipped. These two &quot;great lights&quot; are the sun and the moon; and they may well be called great, especially the former, for the diameter of the sun is reckoned to be about eight hundred thousand miles. According to Mr. DerhamF9Astro-Theology, B. 1. c. 2. & B. 6. c. 2.  its apparent diameter is computed at 822,145 English miles, its ambit at 2,582,873 miles, and its solid contents at 290,971,000,000,000,000: the lowest account makes the sun a hundred thousand times bigger than the earth; and according to Sir Isaac Newton it is 900,000 bigger. The moon's diameter is to that of the earth is about twenty seven per cent, or 2175 miles, its surface contains fourteen hundred thousand square milesF11Chambers's Dictionary in the word &quot;Moon&quot;. : it is called great, not on account of its corporeal quantity, for it is the least of all the planets excepting Mercury, but because of its quality, as a light, it reflecting more light upon the earth than any besides the sun, </p>
<p> The greater light to rule the day : not to rule men, though the heathens have worshipped it under the names of Molech and Baal, which signify king and lord, as if it was their lord and king to whom they were to pay homage; but to rule the day, to preside over it, to make it, give light in it, and continue it to its proper length; and in which it rules alone, the moon, nor any of the other planets then appearing: this is called the &quot;greater&quot; light, in comparison of the moon, not only with respect to its body or substance, but on account of its light, which is far greater and stronger than that of the moon; and which indeed receives its light from it, the moon being, as is generally said, an opaque body: </p>
<p> and the lesser light to rule the night ; to give light then, though in a fainter, dimmer way, by reflecting it from the sun; and it rules alone, the sun being absent from the earth, and is of great use to travellers and sailors; it is called the lesser light, in comparison of the sun. Astronomers are of opinion, as CalmetF12Dictionary in the word &quot;Moon&quot;.  observes, that it is about fifty two times smaller than the earth, and four thousand one hundred and fifty times smaller than the sun; but these proportions are otherwise determined by the generality of modern astronomers: however, they all agree that the moon is abundantly less than the sun; and that it is as a light, we all know, </p>
<p> He made the stars also ; to rule by night, Psalm 136:9   not only the planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, but the vast numbers of stars with which the heavens are bespangled, and which reflect some degree of light upon the earth; with the several constellations, some of which the Scriptures speak of, as Arcturus, Orion, Pleiades, and the chambers of the south, Job 9:9 , Job 38:31   though some restrain this to the five planets only.

<p> On the fourth day the luminaries came into existence. Since God has foreknowledge, he understood the nonsense of the foolish philosophers who were going to say that the things produced on earth came from the stars, so that they might set God aside. In order therefore that the truth might be demonstrated, plants and seeds came into existence before stars. For what comes into existence later cannot cause what is prior to it.' </p>

<p>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven ,.... He not only ordered that there they should be, and made them that there they might be, but he placed them there with his own hands; and they are placed, particularly the sun, at such a particular distance as to be beneficial and not hurtful: had it been set nearer to the earth, its heat would have been intolerable; and had it been further off it would have been of no use; in the one case we should have been scorched with its heat, and in the other been frozen up for the want of it. The various expressions used seem to be designed on purpose to guard against and expose the vanity of the worship of the sun and moon; which being visible, and of such great influence and usefulness to the earth, were the first the Heathens paid adoration to, and was as early as the times of Job, Job 31:26   and yet these were but creatures made by God, his servants and agents under him, and therefore to worship them was to serve the creature besides the Creator, </p>
<p> To give light upon the earth ; this is repeated from Genesis 1:15   to show the end for which they were made, and set up, and the use they were to be of to the earth; being hung up like so many lamps or chandeliers, to contain and send forth light unto the earth, to the inhabitants of it, that they may see to walk and work by, and do all the business of life, as well as be warmed and comforted thereby, and the earth made fertile to bring forth its precious fruits for the use of creatures in it: and it is marvellous that such light should be emitted from the sun, when it is at such a vast distance from the earth, and should reach it in so short a space. A modern astronomerF13Huygen. Cosmotheoros. l. 2. p. 125.  observes, that a bullet discharged from a cannon would be near twenty five years, before it could finish its journey from the sun to the earth: and yet the rays of light reach the earth in seven minutes and a half, and are said to pass ten millions of miles in a minute. </p>

<p> and every winged fowl after his kind ; every fowl, and the various sorts of them that fly in the air; these were all created by God, or produced out of the water and out of the earth by his wonderful power: </p>
<p> and God saw that it was good ; or foresaw that those creatures he made in the waters and in the air would serve to display the glory of his perfections, and be very useful and beneficial to man, he designed to create. (Some of the creatures described by the ancients must refer to animals that are now extinct. Some of these may have been very large dinasours. Ed.) </p>

<p> saying, be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas : and these creatures do multiply exceedingly, and vast quantities there are of them in the mighty waters, though the consumption of some sorts of them is very great.

<p>And God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind ,.... All sorts of living creatures that live and move upon the earth; not that the earth was endued with a power to produce these creatures of itself, without the interposition of God: for though it might be impregnated with a quickening virtue by the Spirit of God, which moved on it whilst a fluid, and had been prepared and disposed for such a production by the heat of the body of light created on the first day, and of the sun on the fourth; yet no doubt it was by the power of God accompanying his word, that these creatures were produced of the earth, and formed into their several shapes. The Heathens had some traditionary notion of this affair: according to the Egyptians, whose sentiments Diodorus SiculusF3Bibliothec. l. 1. p. 7.  seems to give us, the process was thus carried on; the earth being stiffened by the rays of the sun, and the moist matter being made fruitful by the genial heat, at night received nourishment by the mist which fell from the ambient air; and in the day was consolidated by the heat of the sun, till at length the enclosed foetus having arrived to a perfect increase, and the membranes burnt and burst, creatures of all kinds appeared; of whom those that had got a greater degree of heat went upwards, and became flying fowl; those that were endued with an earthly concretion were reckoned in the class or order of reptiles, and other terrestrial animals; and those that chiefly partook of a moist or watery nature, ran to the place of a like kind, and were called swimmers or fish. This is the account they give; and somewhat like is that which Archelaus, the master of Socrates, delivers as his notion, that animals were produced out of slime, through the heat of the earth liquefying the slime like milk for foodF4Laert. in Vita Archelai, p. 99. : and Zeno the Stoic saysF5Ib. in Vita Zenonis, p. 524. , the grosser part of the watery matter of the world made the earth, the thinner part the air, and that still more subtilized, the fire; and then out of the mixture of these proceeded plants and animals, and all the other kinds; but all this they seem to suppose to be done by the mere efforts of nature; whereas Moses here most truly ascribes their production to the all powerful Word of God: </p>
<p> cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the earth after his kind ; the living creatures produced out of the earth are distinguished into three sorts; &quot;cattle&quot;, which seem to design tame cattle, and such as are for the use of man, either for carriage, food, or clothing, as horses, asses, camels, oxen, sheep, &c. and &quot;creeping&quot; things, which are different from the creeping things in the sea before mentioned, are such as either have no feet, and go upon their bellies, or are very short, and seem to do so, whether greater or lesser, as serpents, worms, ants, &c, </p>
<p> and the beast of the earth  seems to design wild beasts, such as lions, bears, wolves, &c, </p>
<p> and it was so ; such creatures were immediately produced. </p>

<p>And God made the beast of the earth after his kind ,.... The wild beasts, and the several sorts of them; beginning the account with the last mentioned, as is frequent in the Hebrew language, and so he made all the rest: </p>
<p> and cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind ; tame creatures, and all the reptiles of the earth: this most clearly shows and proves that the above creatures were not produced by the mere force of nature, or the powers the earth were possessed of, however the matter of it might be disposed and prepared, but by the omnipotent hand of God: </p>
<p> and God saw that it was good ; that every creature he had made would some way or other be for his glory, and for the benefit of man. Picherellus thinks that all this belongs to the work of the fifth day, not the sixth; because as the vegetables, herbs, and trees were produced on the same day, the third day; so animals, whether in the waters, air, or earth, were made on one and the same day; and that it was proper a separate day should be allotted for the formation of rational creatures, Adam and Eve, and that it might appear that the same blessing was not conferred on brutes as on reasonable beings; and therefore the words with which Genesis 1:24   begins should be rendered, &quot;but after God had said, let the earth&quot;, &c. that is, after God had ordered this, and it was done, then &quot;the evening and the morning were the fifth day&quot;; which is what rhetoricians call an &quot;hysteron proteron&quot;. </p>

<p>And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness ,.... These words are directed not to the earth, out of which man was made, as consulting with it, and to be assisting in the formation of man, as Moses Gerundensis, and other Jewish writersF6Vet. Nizzachon, p. 5. Lipman. Carmen Memorial. p. 108. apud Wagenseil. Tela ignea, vol. 1. , which is wretchedly stupid; nor to the angels, as the Targum of Jonathan, Jarchi, and others, who are not of God's privy council, nor were concerned in any part of the creation, and much less in the more noble part of it: nor are the words spoken after the manner of kings, as Saadiah, using the plural number as expressive of honour and majesty; since such a way of speaking did not obtain very early, not even till the close of the Old Testament: but they are spoken by God the Father to the Son and Holy Ghost, who were each of them concerned in the creation of all things, and particularly of man: hence we read of divine Creators and Makers in the plural number, Job 35:10   and Philo the Jew acknowledges that these words declare a plurality, and are expressive of others, being co-workers with God in creationF7De confusione Ling. p. 344. De Profugis, p. 460. De Opificio, p. 16. : and man being the principal part of the creation, and for the sake of whom the world, and all things in it were made, and which being finished, he is introduced into it as into an house ready prepared and furnished for him; a consultation is held among the divine Persons about the formation of him; not because of any difficulty attending it, but as expressive of his honour and dignity; it being proposed he should be made not in the likeness of any of the creatures already made, but as near as could be in the likeness and image of God. The Jews sometimes say, that Adam and Eve were created in the likeness of the holy blessed God, and his ShechinahF8Tikkune Zohar, correct. 64. fol. 98. 2. ; and they also speakF9Ibid. correct. 70. fol. 119. 1.  of Adam Kadmon the ancient Adam, as the cause of causes, of whom it is said, &quot;I was as one brought up with him (or an artificer with him), Proverbs 8:30   and to this ancient Adam he said, &quot;let us make man in our image, after our likeness&quot;: and again, &quot;let us make man&quot;; to whom did he say this? the cause of causes said to &quot;`jod', he, `vau', he&quot;; that is, to Jehovah, which is in the midst of the ten numerations. What are the ten numerations? &quot;`aleph', he, `jod', he&quot;, that is, &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; , &quot;I am that I am, Exodus 3:14   and he that says let us make, is Jehovah; I am the first, and I am the last, and beside me there is no God: and three jods &#1497;&#1497;&#1497;   testify concerning him, that there is none above him, nor any below him, but he is in the middle: </p>
<p> and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air ; that is, to catch them, and eat them; though in the after grant of food to man, no mention as yet is made of any other meat than the herbs and fruits of the earth; yet what can this dominion over fish and fowl signify, unless it be a power to feed upon them? It may be observed, that the plural number is used, &quot;let them&quot;, which shows that the name &quot;man&quot; is general in the preceding clause, and includes male and female, as we find by the following verse man was created: </p>
<p> and over the cattle, and over all the earth ; over the tame creatures, either for food, or clothing, or carriage, or for all of them, some of them for one thing, and some for another; and over all the wild beasts of the earth, which seem to be meant by the phrase, &quot;over all the earth&quot;; that is, over all the beasts of the earth, as appears by comparing it with Genesis 1:24   so as to keep them in awe, and keep them off from doing them any damage: </p>
<p> and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; to make use of it as should seem convenient for them. </p>

<p>So God created man in his own image ,.... Which consisted both in the form of his body, and the erect stature of it, different from all other creatures; in agreement with the idea of that body, prepared in covenant for the Son of God, and which it was therein agreed he should assume in the fulness of time; and in the immortality of his soul, and in his intellectual powers, and in that purity, holiness, and righteousness in which he was created; as well as in his dominion, power, and authority over the creatures, in which he was as God's viceregent, and resembled him. The Jerusalem Targum is, </p>
<p> the Word of the Lord created man in his likeness; even that Word that was in the beginning with God, and was God, and in time became incarnate, by whom all things were made, John 1:1 . </p>
<p> in the image of God created he him ; which is repeated for the certainty of it, and that it might be taken notice of, as showing man's superior glory and dignity to the rest of the creatures, 1 Corinthians 11:7 . </p>
<p> male and female created he them ; not that man was created an hermaphrodite, or with two bodies, back to back united together, and afterwards cleaved asunder, as the Jews fabulously say; but first God made man, or the male, out of the dust of the earth, and infused a rational soul into him; and then out of one of his ribs made a female, or woman, who was presented to him as his wife, that so their species might be propagated; and only one male and one female were created, to show that hereafter a man was to have at a time no more wives than one; see Malachi 2:15   for all that is said in the following chapter, concerning the formation of man out of the dust of the earth, and the making of woman out of his rib, and presenting her to him, and his taking her to be his wife, were all done on this sixth day, and at this time. It is a tradition among the Heathens, that man was made last of all the creatures; so says PlatoF11Protagor. p. 320, 321. ; and this notion the Chinese also haveF12Martin. Sinic. Hist. l. 1. p. 4. . The Jews give these reasons why man was made on the evening of the sabbath, to show that he did not assist in the work of creation; and that if he was elated in his mind, it might be told him that a fly was created before him, and that he might immediately enter on the command, i.e. of the sabbathF13T.

<p> and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; all but the tree of knowledge, of good and evil, afterwards excepted; and both these take in all kind of vegetables, all herbs, plants, roots, even corn, wheat, barley, pease, beans, &c. and the various fruits of all sorts of trees, but that before mentioned: </p>

<p>And God saw everything that he had made ,.... Either all that he had made on the several six days of the creation, he took a survey of them, looked over them again, as workmen do when they have finished their work, to see if anything is amiss or wanting; not that anything of this nature can be supposed in the works of God, but such a survey is attributed to him after the manner of men, to show the completeness of his works, and the excellency of them. PicherellusF17In Cosmopoeiam, p. 2841.  limits this to what had been done on this day, with respect to man, who alone, as he thinks, was the subject of this day's work; and so it respects the creation of man after the image and likeness of God; the forming of the woman out of his rib, and so providing a suitable helper for him; giving them dominion over all the creatures, and suitable food for the support of the animal life; and God reflected on this, and foresaw it would be good in the issue, as it was in itself, </p>
<p> And behold, it was very good ; it had been said of everything else, at the close of each day's work, excepting the second, that it was good; but here the expression is stronger upon the creation of man, the chief and principal work of God, that it was &quot;very good&quot;; he being made upright and holy, bearing the image of his Creator upon him, and in such circumstances as to be happy and comfortable himself, and to glorify God: the phrase may be expressive not only of the goodness of everything God had made, as it was in itself, and in its use; but of his complacency, and delight therein, every thing being made for himself and for, his pleasure, Revelation 4:11 . </p>
<p> and the evening and the morning were the sixth day ; by that time all these works on this day were finished; the sun had gone round the earth, or the earth about that, for the space of twenty four hours, which completed the sixth day, within which term of time God had determined to finish all his works, as he did. This day, according to Capellus, was the twenty third of April, and, according, to Archbishop Usher, the twenty eighth of October, or, as others, the sixth of September. Mr. Whiston, as has been before observed, is of opinion, that the six days of the creation were equal to six years: and the Persians have a tradition, which they pretend to have received from Zoroastres, that God created the world, not in six natural days, but in six times or spaces of different length, called in their tongue &quot;Ghahan barha&quot;. The first of these spaces, in which the heavens were created, was a space of forty five days; the second, in which the waters were created, sixty days; the third, in which the earth was created, seventy five days; the fourth, in which grass and trees were created, thirty days; the fifth, in which all creatures were made, eighty days; the sixth, in which man was created, seventy five days; in all three hundred sixty five days, or a full yearF18Hyde Hist. Relig. vet. Pers. p. 164, 166, 168, 483, 484. . The first of the six principal good works they are taught to do is to observe the times of the creationF19Lib. Sad-der, port. 6. 94. apud Hyde, ib. p. 439, 483. . And the ancient Tuscans or Etrurians allot six thousand years to the creation; the order of which, with them, is much the same with the Mosaic account, only making a day a thousand years: in the first thousand, they say, God made the heaven and the earth; in the next, the firmament, which appears to us, calling it heaven; in the third, the sea, and all the waters that are in the earth; in the fourth, the great lights, the sun and moon, and also the stars; in the fifth, every volatile, reptile, and four footed animal, in the air, earth and water, (which agrees with Picherellus); see Gill on Genesis 1:25 , and in the sixth, man; and whereas they say God employed twelve thousand years in all his creation, and the first six being passed at the creation of man, it seems, according to them, that mankind are to continue for the other six thousand yearsF20See Universal History, vol. 1. p. 64. . And it is a notion that obtains among the Jews, that, answerable to the six days of creation, the world will continue six thousand years. It is a tradition of EliasF21T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 97. 1. Avoda Zara, fol. 9. 1. , an ancient Jewish doctor, that </p>
<p> &quot;the world shall stand six thousand years, two thousand void, two thousand under the law, and two thousand, the days of the Messiah.' </p>
<p> And Baal HatturimF23Comment. in Gen. i. 1.  observes, there are six &quot;alephs&quot; in the first verse of this chapter, answerable to the six thousand years the world is to continue: and R. Gedaliah saysF24Shalshelet Hakabala, fol. 36. 1. , at the end of the sixth millennium the world shall return without form and void, (to its former condition, &quot;tohu&quot; and &quot;bohu&quot;,) and the whole shall be a sabbath: and very particular is another writerF25Comment. in Maimon. Hilch. Teshuva, c. 9. sect. 2.  of theirs concerning these six days of the creation, who having spoken of the day of judgment, the resurrection of the dead, and the world to come, observes, that the six days' work is an intimation and sign of these things: on the sixth day man was created, and the work was perfected on the seventh; so the kings of the nations shall be in the world five thousand years, answerable to the five days in which the fowls, and creeping things of the waters, and the rest, were created; and the holding of their kingdoms will be a little within the sixth millennium, answerable to the creation of cattle and beasts, who were now created on the beginning of it, the &quot;sixth day&quot;; and the kingdom of the house of David will be in the sixth millennium, answerable to the creation of man, who knew his Creator, and ruled over them all; and at the end of that millennium will be the day of judgment, answerable to man's being judged at the end of it, &quot;the sixth day; and the seventh millennium will be the sabbath&quot;. And a like notion obtains among the Persian Magi; it is said that Zerdusht, or Zoroastres, was born in the middle age of the world, so it was told him from the age of Keiomaras (the first man) unto thy age are 3000 years, and from this thy age unto the resurrection are 3000 yearsF26Lib.

<p>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished ,.... Perfected and completed in the space of six days, gradually, successively, in the manner before related; by the word and power of God they were on the first day created out of nothing, but they were not perfected, beautified, and adorned, and filled, until all the creatures in the were made: </p>
<p> and all the host them , of the heavens and the earth; the host of heavens are the sun, moon, and stars, often so called in Scripture, and also the angels; see Luke 2:13   wherefore this may be considered as a proof of their creation within the above space of time, probably on the first day, though the Jews commonly say on the second; for if all the host of heaven were made at this time, and angels are at least a part of that host, then they must be then made, or otherwise all the host of heaven were not then and there made, as here affirmed: and the host of the earth, or terraqueous globe, are the plants, herbs, and trees, the fowls, fishes, animals, and man; and these are like hosts or armies, very numerous, and at the command of God, and are marshalled and kept in order by him; even some of the smallest of creatures are his army, which are at his beck, and he can make use of to the annoyance of others, as particularly the locusts are called, Joel 2:11 . </p>

<p>And on the seventh day God ended his work, which he had made ,.... Not that God wrought anything on the seventh day, or finished any part of his work on that day, because he could not then be said to rest from all his work, as be is afterwards twice said to do; and because of this seeming difficulty the Septuagint, Samaritan, and Syriac versions, read, &quot;on the sixth day&quot;. The two latter versions following the former, which so translated for the sake of Ptolemy king of Egypt, as the Jews sayF1T. Bab.

<p>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it ,.... A day in which he took delight and pleasure, having finished all his works, and resting from them, and looking over them as very good; and so he pronounced this day a good and happy day, and &quot;sanctified&quot; or appointed it in his mind to be a day separated from others, for holy service and worship; as it was with the Jews when they became a body of people, both civil and ecclesiastical: or this is all said by way of prolepsis or anticipation, as many things in this chapter are, many names of countries and rivers, by which being called in the times of Moses, are here given them, though they were not called by them so early, nor till many ages after: and according to Jarchi this passage respects future time, when God &quot;blessed&quot; this day with the manna, which descended on all the days of the week, an omer for a man, and on the sixth day double food; and he &quot;sanctified&quot; it with the manna which did not descend at all on that day: besides, these words may be read in a parenthesis, as containing an account of a fact that was done, not at the beginning of the world, and on the first seventh day of it; but of what had been done in the times of Moses, who wrote this, after the giving of the law of the sabbath; and this being given through his hands to the people of Israel, he takes this opportunity here to insert it, and very pertinently, seeing the reason why God then, in the times of Moses, blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it, was, because he had rested on that day from all his works, Exodus 20:11   and the same reason is given here, taken plainly out of that law which he had delivered to them: </p>
<p> because that in it he had rested from all his work, which God created and made ; which shows, that this refers not to the same time when God blessed and hallowed the seventh day, which was done in the times of Moses, but to what had been long before, and was then given as a reason enforcing it; for it is not here said, as in the preceding verse, &quot;he rested&quot;, but &quot;had rested&quot;, even from the foundation of the world, when his works were finished, as in Hebrews 4:3   even what &quot;he created to make&quot;F5&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1493;&#1514;   &quot;creavit ut faceret&quot;, V.

<p>And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth ,.... That is, God made it, even he who made the heavens and the earth; for these words depend upon the preceding, and are in close connection with them; signifying that the plants of the field, which were made out of the earth on the third day, were made before any were planted in it, or any seed was sown therein from whence they could proceed, and therefore must be the immediate production of divine power: </p>
<p> and every herb of the field before it grew : those at once sprung up in perfection out of the earth, before there were any that budded forth, and grew up by degrees to perfection, as herbs do now: </p>
<p> for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth : so that the production of plants and herbs in their first formation could not be owing to that; since on the third day, when they were made, there was no sun to exhale and draw up the waters into the clouds, in order to be let down again in showers of rain: </p>
<p> and there was not a man to till the ground ; who was not created till the sixth day, and therefore could have no concern in the cultivation of the earth, and of the plants and herbs in it; but these were the produce of almighty power, without the use of any means: some Jewish writersF6Zohar in Gen. fol. 32. 4. , by the plant and herb of the field, mystically understand the first and second Messiah, for they sometimes feign two; see Isaiah 4:2 . </p>

Vatablus, Piscator, Pareus, Drusius, Cartwright; &quot;ornaverat plantis&quot;, Junius & Tremellius. , for this was not now done after the formation of man, but before; and so the word translated &quot;eastward&quot; may be rendered, as it is by some, &quot;before&quot;F14&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;   &quot;a principio&quot;, V. L. so Onkelos; &quot;antes vel antequam&quot;, same in Fagius, Cartwright. : for the plain meaning is, that God had planted a garden before he made man, even on the third day, when all herbs, and plants, and trees were produced out of the earth. The whole world was as a garden, in comparison of what it is now since the fall: what then must this spot of ground, this garden be, which was separated and distinguished from the rest, and the more immediate plantation of God, and therefore is called the garden of the Lord, Genesis 13:10   and which PlatoF15In Symposio, apud Euseb. praepar. Evangel. l. 12. c. 11. p. 584.  calls    &#948;&#953;&#959;&#962;     &#954;&#951;&#960;&#959;&#962; , &quot;Jove's garden?&quot; This garden was planted in the country of Eden, so called very probably from its being a very pleasant and delightful country; and though it is not certain, and cannot be said exactly where it was, yet it seems to be a part of Mesopotamia, since it is more than once mentioned with Haran, which was in that country, 2 Kings 19:12   and since it was by the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, when they were become one stream, which ran through this country, and parted again at this garden; and the country there, as HerodotusF16Clio sive, l. 1. c. 193.  says, is the most fruitful he ever saw; and it seems to be much better to place it here than in Armenia, where the fountain of these rivers is said to be: so TournefortF17Voyage to the Levant, vol. 3. p. 161, 162.  thinks it lay in the country, or plain of the three churches (or Ejmiadzit), in Armenia, about twenty French leagues distant from the heads of Euphrates and Araxes, and near as many from the Phasis, a country exceeding pleasant and fruitful. A very learned manF18Nichol. Abrami Pharus Vet. Test. l. 2. c. 16. p. 56. So Texelius (Phoenix, l. 3. c. 7. sect. 7.) takes it to be in the land of Promise, not far from the Dead sea, or sea of Sodom, and in the country about Jordan; and of the same opinion is Heidegger (Hist. Patriarch. Exerc. 4. sect. 42. p. 15.)  is of opinion, that the garden of Eden was in the land of Judea to the east, by the lake of Gennesaret or Tiberias, and the lake of Asphaltites, called the Dead sea, and takes in, in its compass, the famous valley, or the great plain, and the plains of Jericho, and great part of Galilee, and all that tract which Jordan flows by, from Gennesaret to the country of Sodom; and he takes the river Jordan to be &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;  &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; , &quot;the river of Eden&quot;, from whence it has its name of Jordan; and Gennesaret he interprets as if it was &#1490;&#1503;  &#1513;&#1512; , &quot;Gansar&quot;, the garden of the prince, that is, of Adam, the prince of all mankind. He argues from the situation of the place, and the pleasantness and fruitfulness of it, the balsam of Jericho, and other odoriferous plants that grew there, and what are called the apples of paradise: and it must be owned, that this country abounded with gardens and orchards: it is mentioned in the Jewish Misnah, where the commentatorsF19Maimon. & Bartenora in Misn. Maaserot, c. 3. sect. 7.  say, it was a country in the land of Israel, in which were many gardens and orchards, that produced excellent fruit; and the fruits of Gennesaret are spoken of in the TalmudF20T. Bab. Beracot, fol. 44. 1. Erubin, fol. 30. 1. & Pesachim, fol. 8. 2.  as exceeding sweet: and with this agrees the account JosephusF21De Bello Jud. l. 3. c. 9. sect. 8.  gives of it, that it is&quot;wonderful in nature and goodness, and through its fertility refuses no plant; everything is set here; the temper of the air suits with different things; here grow nuts, and more winter fruit; and there palms, which are nourished with heat, and near them figs and olives, which require a softer air--not only it produces apples of different sorts, beyond belief, but long preserves them; and indeed the most excellent of fruit; grapes and figs it furnishes with for ten months, without intermission, and other fruit throughout the whole year, growing old, with them.'And it may be further observed, that it is asked by the Jewish Rabbins, why it is called Genesar? and the answer is, because &#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; , &quot;the gardens of princes&quot;; these are the kings who have gardens in the midst of it: another reason is given, because it belonged to Naphtali, a portion in the midst of it, as it is said, and of &quot;Naphtali a thousand princes&quot;, 1 Chronicles 12:34 .F23Aruch in voce &#1490;&#1504;&#1505;&#1512; , fol. 37. 1.  And it is worthy of remark, that Strabo calls Jericho, which was within this tract, &quot;the paradise of balsam&quot;F24Geograph. l. 16. p. 525. ; and there, and hereabout, as Diodorus SiculusF25Bibliothec. l. 19. p. 734. , and JustinF26E Trogo, l. 36. c. 3.  relate, grew this aromatic plant, and nowhere else; it was not to be found in any other part of the world. And it appears from Scripture, that if the plain of Jordan was not the garden of Eden, it is said to be, &quot;as the garden of the Lord&quot;, Genesis 13:10   and if the &quot;caph&quot; or &quot;as&quot; is not a note of similitude, but of reality, as it sometimes is, it proves it to be the very place; and the above learned writer takes it to be not comparative, but illative, as giving a reason why it was so well watered, because it was the garden of the Lord: and the Jews have some notion of this, for they say, if that the garden of Eden is in the land of Israel, Bethshean is the door of it, or entrance into it; the gloss gives this reason, because the fruits were sweeter than any otherF1T. Bab. Erubin, fol. 19. 1. ; and this was near, at the entrance of the great plain before mentioned; and before which was this place, as Josephus saysF2Antiqu. l. 12. c. 8. sect. 5. 1 Maccab. v. 52. : and if the garden of Eden was in those parts, it may be observed, that where the first Adam first dwelt, and where he sinned and fell, Christ the second Adam frequently was; here he conversed much, taught his doctrines, wrought his miracles; and even here he appeared after his resurrection from the dead. But the opinions of men about this place are very many, and there is scarce any country in the whole world but one or another has placed the garden of Eden in it; nay, some have assigned a place for it out of the earth, in the eighth sphere. Such a garden undoubtedly there was somewhere, and it is said to be placed &quot;eastward&quot;, either in the eastern part of the country of Eden, see Genesis 4:16   or to the east of the desert where Moses was when he wrote; or to the east of Judea, as Mesopotamia was: and if this garden was in Judea, the place assigned for it by the above learned person, it was in the eastern part of that country; see Numbers 32:19 . This garden was an emblem either of the church of Christ on earth, which is a garden enclosed, surrounded with divine power, and distinguished with divine grace; a small spot in comparison of the world; is of Jehovah's planting, and is his property; and is an Eden to his people, where they enjoy much spiritual pleasure and delight: or however of the place and state of the happiness of the saints in the other world, often called a paradise in allusion to this, Luke 23:43   and which is of God's planting, and therefore called the paradise of God, and is an Eden, where are pleasures for evermore: and this seems to be what the Jews mean when they sayF3T. Bab. Pesachim, fol. 54. 1. Nedarim, fol. 39. 2. , that the garden of Eden, or paradise, was created before the world was; which is no other than what Christ says of it in other words, Matthew 25:34 . </p>
<p> and there he put the man whom he had formed ; not as soon as he had planted the garden, but as soon as he had made man; and from hence it is generally concluded, that man was made without the garden, and brought from the place where he was formed, and put into it; and which some say was near Damascus: but be it where it will, it is most probable that it was not far from the garden; though there seems no necessity for supposing him to be made out of it; for the putting him into it may signify the appointing and ordering him to be there, and fixing and settling him in it, for the ends and uses mentioned, see Genesis 2:15 . (After the global destruction of Noah's flood, it is doubtful that the location of the Garden of Eden could be determined with any degree of certainty today. Ed.) </p>

<p>And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food ,.... That is, out of the ground of the garden of Eden; and this was done on the third day, when the whole earth brought forth grass, herbs, and trees: but a peculiar spot of ground was fixed on for man, and stocked with trees of all sorts for his use, not only to bear fruit, which would be suitable and agreeable food for him, but others also, which would yield him delight to look at; such as the tall cedars for their loftiness, spreading branches and green leaves, with many others; so that not only there were trees to gratify the senses of tasting and smelling, but that of sight; and such a sightly goodly tree to look at was the tree of knowledge, Genesis 3:6 . These trees may be an emblem of the saints, the trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, and made to grow by him through the influence of his Spirit and grace; and whom he plants in his gardens, the churches, and transplants into the heavenly paradise, and are often compared to palm trees, cedars, olive trees, pomegranates, &c. </p>
<p> the tree of life also in the midst of the garden ; set there as in the most excellent place, where it might be most conspicuous, and to be come at; for before Adam sinned, as there was no prohibition of his eating of it, so there was no obstruction to it; and as he had a grant to eat of it, with the other trees, it was designed for his use, to support and maintain his natural life, which would have been continued, had he persisted in his obedience and state of innocence, and very probably by means of this chiefly: hence the son of Sirach calls it the tree of immortality,&quot;The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality.' (Sirach 19:19)and it might be also a sign, token, and symbol to him of his dependence on God; that he received his life from him; and that this was preserved by his blessing and providence, and not by his own power and skill; and that this would be continued, provided he transgressed not the divine law: and it seems to have a further respect, even to eternal life; by Christ; for though it might not be a symbol of that life to Adam in his state of innocence, yet it became so after his fall: hence Christ is sometimes signified by the tree of life, Proverbs 3:18   who is not only the author of natural and spiritual life, but the giver of eternal life; the promise of it is in him, and the blessing itself; he has made way for it by his obedience, sufferings, and death, and is the way unto it; it is in his gift, and he bestows it on all his people, and it will lie greatly in the enjoyment of him. The situation of this tree in the midst of the garden well agrees with him who is in the midst of his church and people, Revelation 1:13   stands open, is in sight, and is accessible to them all now, who may come to him, and partake of the fruits and blessings of his grace, which are many, constant, and durable, Revelation 22:2   and who will be seen and enjoyed by all, to all eternity: </p>
<p> and the tree of knowledge of good and evil ; so called, either with respect to God, who by it tried man, when he had made him, whether he would be good or evil; but this he foreknew: rather therefore with respect to man, not that the eating the fruit of it could really give him such knowledge, nor did he need it; for by the law of nature inscribed on his heart, he knew the difference between good and evil, and that what God commanded was good, and what he forbid was evil: but either it had its name from the virtue Satan ascribed to it, Genesis 3:5   or from the sad event following on man's eating the fruit of it, whereby he became experimentally sensible of the difference between good and evil, between obedience and disobedience to the will of God; he found by sad experience what good he had lost, or might have enjoyed, and what evil he had brought on himself and his posterity, he might have avoided. What this tree was is not certain; there are various conjectures about it, and nothing else can be come at concerning it. Some take it to be the fig tree, as Jarchi, and some in Aben Ezra on Genesis 3:6   because fig leaves were at hand, and immediately made use of on eating the fruit of it; some the vine, and particularly the black grape, as in the book of ZoharF4In Exod. fol. 59. 4. & in Numb. fol. 53. 3. So in Bereshit Rabba, sect. 12. fol. 155. 2. ; others, as Baal Hatturim on Genesis 1:29   the pome citron, or citron apple treeF5Vid. Caphtor Uperah, fol. 49. 1. & 60. 2. & 63. 2. ; others, the common apple, as the author of the old NizzechonF6P. 147. Ed.

<p>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden ,.... Before man was created, as Aben Ezra observes, this river went out of Eden and watered it on every side; but what river is here meant, is hard to say. It is more generally thought to be the river Euphrates, when that and the Tigris met, and became one stream or river, and as such entered and passed through Eden; and as it was parted into four rivers afterwards, in two of which they retained their names: the learned RelandF11Dissert. de Paradiso, p. 53.  thinks, this river is now lost; but the learned writer before referred to thinks, as has been observed, that it is the river Jordan; see note on Genesis  2:8   and which, as PlinyF12Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 15.  says, was a very pleasant river: </p>
<p> and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads ; after it had passed through Eden, and the garden in it, watering it, it divided into four parts or heads of water, or four chief principal rivers, hereafter mentioned; and which circumstance the above writer thinks makes it the more probable to be the river Jordan, which and with the four rivers are spoken of together by the son of Sirach, in the Apocrypha:&quot;25 He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits. 26 He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest. 27 He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage.' (Sirach 24)of which in the following verses. This river may be an emblem of the everlasting love of God, that pure river of water of life, which springs from the throne of God, and of the Lamb, from divine sovereignty, and not from the faith, love, and obedience of man; that river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, and which water the garden, the church, revive its plants, and make it fruitful and delightful; the four heads or branches of which are eternal election of God, particular redemption by Christ, regeneration and sanctification by the Spirit, and eternal life and happiness, as the free gift of God through Christ; see Psalm 46:4 . </p>

So that it seems to be a country in Arabia, near unto, or a part of Cush or Arabia Cusea, and near to Seba or Arabia Felix: and so Strabo, among the nations of the Arabians, and along with the Nabatheans, places the ChaulotaeansF19Ib. p. 528. , who seem to be no other than the posterity of Havilah: according to the learned RelandF20De Paradiso, p. 16, &c. , it is the same with Colchis, a part of Scythia, and Phasis is well known to be a river of Colchis; and which runs into Pontus, as appears from PlinyF21Ut supra. (Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 4. 17.)  and includes Scythia, as JustinF23E Trogo, l. 2. c. 2.  says; and then it must have its name from Havilah, the son of Joktan, Genesis 10:29   and in either of these countries there was gold, and an abundance of it, and of the best, as follows:(After the global destruction of Noah's flood, it is doubtful that the location of these rivers could be determined with any degree of certainty today.

<p>And the gold of that land is good ,.... Arabia was famous for gold: Diodorus SiculusF24Bibliothec. l. 2. p. 133.  speaks of gold in Arabia, called &quot;apyrus&quot;, which is not melted by fire out of small filings, as other; but as soon as dug is said to be pure gold, and that in the size of chestnuts, and of such a flaming colour, that the most precious stones are set in it by artificers for ornament: and in Colchis and Scythia, as StraboF25Geograph. l. 1. p. 31. & l. 11. p. 344.  relates, there are rivers which produce gold; and from whence came the fable of the golden fleece, the Argonauts went to Colchis for: </p>
<p> there is the bdellium, and the onyx stone ; the first of these is either an aromatic gum; the tree, according to PlinyF26Nat. Hist. l. 12. c. 9. , is black, and is of the size of an olive tree, has the leaf of an oak, and its fruit is like capers; it is found in Arabia, India, Media, and Babylon; but the best, according to him, is in Bactriana, and, next to that, the bdellium of Arabia: or else it is a precious stone, and which the Jewish writersF1Jarchi in Numb. xi. 7. David de Pomis Tzemach David, fol. 8. 3.  commonly take to be crystal; and, according to SolinusF2Polyhistor. c. 25. , the best crystal is in Scythia. BochartF3Hierozoic. par. 2. l. 5. c. 5. p. 675, &c.  would have it that the pearl is meant, because of its whiteness and roundness, for which the manna is compared to it, Numbers 11:7   and the rather because of the pearl fishery at Catipha, taking Havilah to be that part of Arabia which lies upon the Persian gulf. The latter, the onyx, is a precious stone, which has its name from its being of the colour of a man's nail; and, according to PlinyF4Nat. Hist. l. 36. c. 7. , the onyx marble is found in the mountains of Arabia, and the ancients thought it was nowhere else; and he speaks elsewhere of the Arabian onyx precious stone, and of the sardonyx, as in the same countryF5lb. l. 37. c. 6. ; and some think that is here meant; though the word is sometimes by the Septuagint rendered the emerald; and the best of these, according to SolinusF6Polyhistor. ut supra.

<p>And the name of the second river is Gihon ,.... There was one of this name in the land of Israel, which, or a branch of it, flowed near Jerusalem, 1 Kings 1:33   this Aben Ezra suggests is here meant, and which favours the notion of the above learned man, that the garden of Eden was in the land of Israel. JosephusF8Antiqu, l. 1. c. 1. sect. 3. Philostorg. Eccl. Hist. l. 3. c. 10. p. 482.  takes it to be the river Nile, as do many others; it seems to have been a branch of the river Euphrates or Tigris, on the eastern side, as Phison was on the west; and so Aben Ezra says it came from the south east. The learned RelandF9De situ Paradisi, p. 32.  will have it to be the river Araxes: it has its name, according to Jarchi, from the force it goes with, and the noise it makes. And it seems to have its name from &#1490;&#1493;&#1495; , which signifies to come forth with great force, as this river is said to do, when it pours itself into the Baltic sea. </p>
<p> The same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia ; either Ethiopia above Egypt; and this favours the notion of those who take Gihon to be the Nile: for PausaniasF11Corinthiaca sive, l. 2. p. 94.  says, that it was commonly reported that the Nile was Euphrates, which disappearing in a marsh, rose up above Ethiopia, and became the Nile, and so washed that country, and is thought to agree very well with the Mosaic account: or else that Cush or Ethiopia, which bordered on Midian, and was a part of Arabia, and may be called Arabia Chusea, often meant by Cush in Scripture. RelandF12Ut supra, (De situ Paradisi) p. 38.  thinks the country of the Cossaeans or Cussaeans, a people bordering on Media, the country of Kuhestan, a province of Persia, is intended.

<p>The name of the third river is Hiddekel ,.... A river which ran by Shushan in Persia, and retained its name in the times of Daniel, Daniel 10:4   where it is called the great river; and it seems it bears the same name now among the Persians; at least it did an hundred and fifty years ago, when RauwolffF13Travels, part. 2. c. 9. p. 159. ed. Ray.  travelled in those parts. The Targum of Jonathan here calls it Diglath, the same with the Diglito of PlinyF14Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 27. ; and according to him it is called Tigris, from its swiftness, either from the tiger, a swift creature, or from &#1490;&#1512;&#1488; , &quot;to dart&quot;, in the Chaldee language; and so CurtiusF15Hist. l. 4. c. 9.  says, that in the Persian language they call a dart &quot;tigris&quot;: and with this agrees the word &quot;Hiddekel&quot;, which in the Hebrew language signifies sharp and swift, as a polished arrow is; and Jarchi says it is so called, because its waters are sharp and swift: though this is contradicted by some modern travellersF16De la Valle & Thevenot, apud Universal History, vol. 4. p. 248.  who say it is a slower stream than the Euphrates, and is not only very crooked, and full of meanders, but also choked up with islands, and great banks of stone: </p>
<p> that is it which goeth towards the east of Assyria : a country which had its name from Ashur, a son of Shem, Genesis 10:11   it became a famous kingdom and monarchy, Nineveh was the metropolis of it, which was built on the river Tigris or Hiddekel; and, as before observed, it ran by Shushan in Persia; and so, as Diodorus SiculusF17Bibliothec. l. 2. p. 99.  says, it passed through Media into Mesopotamia; and which very well agrees with its being, according to Moses, one of the rivers of Eden. Twelve miles up this river, from Mosul, near which Nineveh once stood, lies an island, called the island of Eden, in the heart of the Tigris, about ten English miles in circuit, and is said to be undoubtedly a part of paradiseF18Cartwright's Preacher's Travels, p. 91. : </p>
<p> and the fourth river is Euphrates : or &quot;Phrat&quot;, as in the Hebrew tongue. RelandF19Ut supra, (De Situ Paradisi) p. 45.  seems rightly to judge, that the syllable &quot;eu&quot;, prefixed to it, is the Persian &quot;au&quot; or &quot;cu&quot;, which in that language signifies &quot;water&quot;; so that &quot;Euphrates&quot; is no other than &quot;the water of Phrat&quot;, so called from the fruitfulness of it; for its waters, as Jarchi says, fructify, increase, and fatten the earth; and who rightly observes that these names, and so those of other rivers, and of the countries here mentioned, are named by a prolepsis or anticipation, these being the names they bore when Moses wrote; unless it may be thought to be the Hebrew &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; , &quot;Hu, the, that Phrat&quot;; and which the Greeks have made an &quot;eu&quot; of.

<p>And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden ,.... This is observed before in Genesis 2:8   and is here repeated to introduce what follows; and is to be understood not of a corporeal assumption, by a divine power lifting him up from the place where he was, and carrying him into another; rather of a manuduction, or taking him by the hand and leading him thither; so Onkelos renders it, he &quot;led&quot; him, that is, he ordered and directed him thither: hence Jarchi paraphrases it, he took him with good words, and persuaded him to go thither: the place from whence he is supposed by some to be taken was near Damascus, where he is by them said to be created; or the place where the temple was afterwards built, as say the Jewish writers: the Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;the Lord God took the man from the mount of Service, the place in which he was created, and caused him to dwell in the garden of Eden.'And elsewhereF20Pirke Eliezer, c. 2. fol. 72. 2.  it is said,&quot;the holy blessed God loved the first Adam with an exceeding great love, for he created him out of a pure and holy place; and from what place did he take him? from the place of the house of the sanctuary, and brought him into his palace, as it is said, Genesis 2:15   &quot;and the Lord God took&quot;, &c.'though no more perhaps is intended by this expression, than that God spoke to him or impressed it on his mind, and inclined him to go, or stay there: </p>
<p> to dress it, and to keep it ; so that it seems man was not to live an idle life, in a state of innocence; but this could not be attended with toil and labour, with fatigue and trouble, with sorrow and sweat, as after his fall; but was rather for his recreation and pleasure; though what by nature was left to be improved by art, and what there was for Adam to do, is not easy to say: at present there needed no ploughing, nor sowing, nor planting, nor watering, since God had made every tree pleasant to the sight, good for food, to grow out of it; and a river ran through it to water it: hence in a Jewish tractF21Pirke Eliezer, c. 2. fol. 72. 2. , before referred to, it is said, that his work in the garden was nothing else but to study in the words of the law, and to keep or observe the way of the tree of life: and to this agree the Targums of Jonathan and of Jerusalem,&quot;and he placed him in the garden of Eden, to serve in the law, and keep the commands of it.'And in another tractF23Tikkune Zohar, correct. 54. fol. 91. 2.  it is said,&quot;God brought Adam the law, Job 28:27   and &quot;he put him in the garden of Eden&quot;; that is, the garden of the law, &quot;to dress it&quot;, to do the affirmative precepts of the law, &quot;and to keep it&quot;, the negative precepts:'though Aben Ezra interprets this service of watering the garden, aud keeping wild beasts from entering into it. And indeed the word may be rendered to &quot;till&quot;, as well as to dress, as it is in Genesis 3:23   and by Ainsworth here; so MiltonF24Paradise Lost, B. 8. l. 320.  expresses it; and some have thought Adam was to have planted and sowed, had he continued in the garden. </p>

<p>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ,.... Of the name of this tree, and the reasons of it; see Gill on Genesis 2:9 . </p>
<p> thou shalt not eat of it ; not that this tree had any efficacy in it to increase knowledge, and improve in science and understanding, as Satan suggested God knew; and therefore forbid the eating of it out of envy to man, which the divine Being is capable of; or that there was anything hurtful in it to the bodies of men, if they had eaten of it; or that it was unlawful and evil of itself, if it had not been expressly prohibited: but it was, previous to this injunction, a quite indifferent thing whether man ate of it or not; and therefore was pitched upon as a trial of man's obedience to God, under whose government he was, and whom it was fit he should obey in all things; and since he had a grant of all the trees of the garden but this, it was the greater aggravation of his offence that he should not abstain from it: </p>

Moreover, a spiritual or moral death immediately ensued; he lost his original righteousness, in which he was created; the image of God in him was deformed; the powers and faculties of his soul were corrupted, and he became dead in sins and trespasses; the consequence of which, had it not been for the interposition of a surety and Saviour, who engaged to make satisfaction to law and justice, must have been eternal death, or an everlasting separation from God, to him and all his posterity; for the wages of sin is death, even death eternal, Romans 6:23 . So the JewsF1Tikkune Zohar, correct. 24. fol. 68. 1. correct. 54. fol. 90. 2. correct. 66. fol. 100. 1.  interpret this of death, both in this world and in the world to come. </p>

<p> to see what he would call them ; what names he would give to them; which as it was a trial of the wisdom of man, so a token of his dominion over the creatures, it being an instance of great knowledge of them to give them apt and suitable names, so as to distinguish one from another, and point at something in them that was natural to them, and made them different from each other; for this does not suppose any want of knowledge in God, as if he did this to know what man would do, he knew what names man would give them before he did; but that it might appear he had made one superior to them all in wisdom and power, and for his pleasure, use, and service; and therefore brings them to him, to put them into his hands, and give him authority over them; and being his own, to call them by what names he pleased: </p>
<p> and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof ; it was always afterwards called by it, by him and his posterity, until the confusion of languages, and then every nation called them as they thought proper, everyone in their own language: and as there is a good deal of reason to believe, that the Hebrew language was the first and original language; or however that eastern language, of which the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, are so many dialects; it was this that he spoke, and in it gave names to the creatures suitable to their nature, or agreeable to some property or other observed in them: and BochartF7Hierozoic. par. 1. l. 1. c. 9. p. 59, &c.  has given us many instances of creatures in the Hebrew tongue, whose names answer to some character or another in them: some think this was done by inspiration; and Plato says, that it seemed to him that that nature was superior to human, that gave names to things; and that this was not the work of vain and foolish man, but the first names were appointed by the godsF8In Cratylo, apud Euseb.

<p>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept ,.... This was not a common and natural sleep that Adam fell into, occasioned by any weariness of the animal spirits, in viewing the creatures as they passed by him, and in examining them, and giving them suitable and proper names; but it was supernatural, and from the Lord, his power and providence, who caused it to fall upon him: it was not a drowsiness, nor a slumber, but a sound sleep: his senses were so locked up by it, that he perceived not anything that was done to him; and it seems to have been on purpose, that he might feel no pain, while the operation was made upon him, as well as that it might appear that he had no hand in the formation of the woman; and that he might be the more surprised at the sight of her, just awaking out of sleep, to see so lovely an object, so much like himself, and made out of himself, and in so short a time as while he was taking a comfortable nap: </p>
<p> and he took one of his ribs ; with the flesh along with it: men have commonly, as anatomistsF11Bartholini Anatomia, l. 4. c. 17. p. 516. Vid. Scheuchzer. Physica Sacra, vol. 1. tab. 27. p. 28.  observe, twelve ribs on a side; it seems by this, that Adam had thirteen. The Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;and he took one of his ribs; that is, the thirteenth rib of his right side:'but our English poetF12Who stooping opened my left side, and took From thence a rib.--- Milton's Paradise Lost, B. 8. l. 465.  takes it to be one of the left side, and also a supernumerary oneF13Ib. B. 10. l. 887. . God made an opening in him, and took it out, without putting him to any pain, and without any sensation of it: in what manner this was done we need not inquire; the power of God was sufficient to perform it; Adam was asleep when it was done, and saw it not, and the manner of the operation is not declared: </p>
<p> and closed up the flesh instead thereof : so that there was no opening left, nor any wound made, or a scar appeared, or any loss sustained, but what was made up by an increase of flesh, or by closing up the flesh; and that being hardened like another rib, and so answered the same purpose. (Adam probably had the same number of ribs as we do today. Otherwise the genetic code for creation of an extra rib would cause at least some people today to have thirteen ribs. I know of no such case. Also, we know that acquired characteristics cannot be passed on to the next generation. A man who loses both legs in an accident, usually has children who have two legs.

<p>Therefore shall a man leave his father, and his mother ,.... These are thought by some to be the words of Moses, inferring from the above fact, what ought to be among men; and by others, the words of Adam under divine inspiration, as the father of mankind instructing his sons what to do, and foretelling what would be done in all succeeding ages: though they rather seem to be the words of God himself, by whom marriage was now instituted; and who here gives direction about it, and declares the case and circumstance of man upon it, and how he would and should behave: and thus our Lord Jesus Christ, quoting these words, makes them to be the words of him that made man, male and female, and supplies and prefaces them thus, and said, &quot;for this cause&quot;, &c. Matthew 19:5   so Jarchi paraphrases them,&quot;the Holy Ghost said so:'not that a man upon his marriage is to drop his affections to his parents, or be remiss in his obedience to them, honour of them, and esteem for then, or to neglect the care of them, if they stand in need of his assistance; but that he should depart from his father's house, and no more dwell with him, or bed and board in his house; but having taken a wife to himself, should provide an habitation for him and her to dwell together: so all the three Targums interpret it, of quitting &quot;the house of his father, and his mother's bed&quot;: </p>
<p> and shall cleave unto his wife ; with a cordial affection, taking care of her, nourishing and cherishing her, providing all things comfortable for her, continuing to live with her, and not depart from her as long as they live: the phrase is expressive of the near union by marriage between man and wife; they are, as it were, glued together, and make but one; which is more fully and strongly expressed in the next clause: </p>
<p> and they shall be one flesh ; that is, &quot;they two&quot;, the man and his wife, as it is supplied and interpreted by Christ, Matthew 19:5   and so here in the Targum of Jonathan, and in the Septuagint and Samaritan versions: the union between them is so close, as if they were but one person, one soul, one body; and which is to be observed against polygamy, unlawful divorces, and all uncleanness, fornication, and adultery: only one man and one woman, being joined in lawful wedlock, have a right of copulation with each other, in order to produce a legitimate offspring, partaking of the same one flesh, as children do of their parents, without being able to distinguish the flesh of the one from the other, they partake of: and from hence it appears to be a fabulous notion, that Cecrops, the first king of Athens, was the first institutor of matrimony and joiner of one man to one woman; whence he was said to be &quot;biformis&quot;F16Justin. e Trogo, l. 2. c. 6. , and was called    &#948;&#953;&#966;&#965;&#951;&#962; ; unless, as someF17Vid.

<p>And they were both naked, the man and his wife ,.... Were as they were created, having no clothes on them, and standing in need of none, to shelter them from the heat or cold, being in a temperate climate; or to conceal any parts of their bodies from the sight of others, there being none of the creatures to guard against on that account: </p>
<p> and were not ashamed ; having nothing in them, or on them, or about them, that caused shame; nothing sinful, defective, scandalous or blameworthy; no sin in their nature, no guilt on their consciences, or wickedness in their hands or actions; and particularly they were not ashamed of their being naked, no more than children are to see each other naked, or we are to behold them: besides, they were not only alone, and none to behold them; but their being naked was no disgrace to them, but was agreeably to their nature; and they were not sensible that there was any necessity or occasion to cover themselves, nor would they have had any, had they continued in their innocent state: moreover, there was not the least reason to be ashamed to appear in such a manner, since they were but one flesh. The Jerusalem Targum is,&quot;they knew not what shame was,'not being conscious of any sin, which sooner or later produces shame. Thus PlatoF18Politico, apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 12. c. 13. p. 588.  describes the first men, who, he says, were produced out of the earth; and for whom the fertile ground and trees brought forth fruit of all kind in abundance of themselves, without any agriculture; that these were    &#947;&#965;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#961;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#953; , &quot;naked and without any covering&quot;; and so Diodories SiculusF19Bibliothec. l. 1. p. 8.  says, the first of men were naked and without clothing.

<p>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field, which the Lord God had made ,.... Many instances are given of the subtlety of serpents, in hiding their heads when struck at, rolling themselves up, stopping their ear at the voice of the charmer, putting off their skin, lying in sand of the same colour with them, and biting the feet of horses, and other things of the like kind; but by these it does not appear to be now more subtle than any other creature, whatever it might be at its first creation; particularly the fox greatly exceeds it: the words therefore may be rendered, &quot;that serpent&quot;; that particular serpent, of which so much is spoken of afterwards; &quot;or the serpent was become&quot;F20&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;   &quot;factus est&quot;, Schmidt. , or &quot;made more subtle&quot;, that is, not naturally, but through Satan being in it, and using it in a very subtle manner, to answer his purposes, and gain his point: for though a real serpent, and not the mere form or appearance of one, is here meant, as is clear from this account, and the curse afterwards pronounced on it; yet not that only, but as possessed and used by Satan as an instrument of his to accomplish his designs, as is evident from its having the faculty of speech, and the use of reason, employed in a very artful and sophistic manner: nor is it rational to suppose that human nature, in the height of its glory and excellency, should be outwitted and seduced by a creature so inferior to it; besides, the Scriptures always ascribe the seduction of man to the devil; who, because he acted his deceitful part in and by the serpent, is called the serpent, and the old serpent, and the devil and Satan, 2 Corinthians 11:3 . The Targum of Jonathan restrains this subtlety to wickedness, paraphrasing the words&quot;but the serpent was wise to evil.'Some Jewish writersF21Tikkune Zohar, correct. 59. fol. 96. 1.  interpret the passage of the nakedness of the serpent, taking the word in the sense it is used in Genesis 2:25   and render it, &quot;more naked than any beast of the field&quot;, the rest having a clothing, as hair, &c. but this none; and so might be more agreeable to Eve, being in this respect like herself; but it is generally interpreted of subtlety. The serpent early became the object of religions worship. Taautus, or the Egyptian Thoth, was the first that attributed deity to the nature of the dragon, and of serpents; and after him the Egyptians and Phoenicians: the Egyptian god Cneph was a serpent with an hawk's head; and a serpent with the Phoenicians was a good demon: what led them to have such veneration for this animal, were its plenty of spirits, its fiery nature, its swiftness, its various forms it throws itself into, and its long lifeF23Philo Byblius, apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 1. c. 10. p. 41. ; and so PherecydesF24Apud, Euseb. ib.  speaks of a deity of the Phoenicians called Ophioneus; and who also affirmsF25Apud L. Vivem in Aug. de Civ. Dei, l. 4. c. 11. , that this was the prince of demons cast down from heaven by Jupiter; and HerodotusF26Euterpe sive, l. 2. c. 74.  makes mention of sacred serpents about Thebes; and AelianusF1De Animal l. 11. c. 2, 17.  of sacred dragons; and Justin Martyr saysF2Apolog. 2. p. 71. , the serpent with the Heathens was a symbol of all that were reckoned gods by them, and they were painted as such; and wherever serpents were painted, according to PersiusF3&quot;Pinge duos angues pueri, sacer est locus.&quot; Satyr. 1. , it was a plain indication that it was a sacred place. Serpents were sacred to many of the Heathen deities, and who were worshipped either in the form of one, or in a real oneF4See more of this in a Sermon of mine, called The Head of the Serpent bruised, &c. ; all which seem to take their rise from the use the devil made of the serpent in seducing our first parents. </p>
<p> And he said to the woman ; being alone, which he took the advantage of; not the serpent, but Satan in it; just as the angel spoke in Balaam's ass; for we are not to imagine with Philo, Josephus, Aben Ezra, and others, that beasts in their original state had the faculty of speech, and whose language Eve understood: it is very probable that good angels appeared in paradise to our first parents, in one form or another, and conversed with them; it may be in an human form, and it may be in the form of a beautiful flying serpent, which looked very bright and shining, and that sort called Seraph, Numbers 21:6   hence angels may bear the name of Seraphim, as some have thought; so that it might not be at all surprising to Eve to hear the serpent speak, it being what she might have been used to hear, and might take this to be a good angel in such a shape, that was come to bring a message to her from God, and to converse with her for her good, and who thus accosted her: </p>
<p> yea, hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ? or &quot;of any tree&quot;F5&#1502;&#1499;&#1500;  &#1506;&#1509;   &quot;ex ulla arbore&quot;, Piscator. ; so ambiguously does he speak, in order to reproach the divine goodness, and draw into a disbelief of it. The speech is abrupt; and, as Kimchi observesF6Sepher Shoresh in voce &#1488;&#1507; . , supposes some discourse, as to this purpose; surely God hates you, for though you are greater than the rest of the creatures, he has not provided any superior excellency for you, and especially since he has said, &quot;ye shall not eat&quot;, &c. Or as others, taking occasion from their being naked, Genesis 2:25   he observes, that that was unbecoming them, of which they might be ashamed; yea, also, that it was unjust to forbid them to eat of the tree of good and evil: he might, it is suggested, first endeavour to persuade the woman, that it was indecent for her, and her husband, to be naked; which they not being convinced of, he insinuated that this was owing to a defect of knowledge, and that there was a tree in the garden, which if they ate of, would give them that knowledge, and therefore God had forbid it, to keep them in ignorance: but he seems to put this question, to cause them to doubt of it, whether there was such a prohibition or not, and as amazing that it should be, and as not believing it to be true; it being, as he would have it, contrary to the perfections of God, to his goodness and liberality, and to his profession of a peculiar respect to man: wherefore the Targum of Onkelos renders it, &quot;of a truth&quot;, and that of Jonathan, &quot;is it true?&quot; surely it cannot be true, that a God of such goodness could ever deny you such a benefit, or restrain you from such happiness; he can never be your friend that can lay such an injunction on you. </p>

Praepar. Evangel. l. 12.) c. 14.  had his notion of the first men discoursing with beasts: </p>
<p> we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden ; of all and every one of them, which is to be understood, excepting the one after mentioned; so far are we from being debarred from eating of any, which the speech of the Serpent might imply, that they were allowed to eat of what they pleased, but one. </p>

<p> God hath said, ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die : here the woman is charged by some both with adding to, and taking from the law of God; and if so, must have sinned very heinously before she eat of the fruit; but neither of them are sufficiently proved; not the former by her saying, &quot;neither shall ye touch it&quot;, which though not expressed in the prohibition, is implied, namely, such a touching the fruit as to pluck it off the tree, take it in the hand, and put it to the mouth, in order to eat it: nor the latter by these words, &quot;lest ye die&quot;, or &quot;lest perhaps ye die&quot;F8&#1508;&#1503;   &quot;ne forte&quot;, V.

God doth know&quot;, who knows all things, and has foreknowledge of all future events; he foreknows what will be the consequence of this event, eating the fruit of this tree, that it would be so far from issuing in death, which he has threatened, that the effect of it would be a clearer understanding, and a greater degree of knowledge of things, which he is unwilling should be enjoyed, and therefore has endeavoured to prevent it by this prohibition; suggesting hereby, even in God, hatred of the creatures he had made, and unwilling they should be as happy as they might: </p>
<p> that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened ; not the eyes of their bodies, as if they were now blind, but the eyes of their understanding; meaning, that their knowledge should be enlarged, and they should see things more clearly than they now did, and judge of them in a better manner; yea, even together with the light of their mind, the sight of their bodily eyes would receive some advantage; and particularly, that though they saw the nakedness of their bodies, yet it was as if they saw it not, and were unconcerned about it, and heedless of it; did not see it as unseemly and indecent, and so were not ashamed; but now they should see it as it was, and be filled with shame and confusion: </p>
<p> and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil : as &quot;Elohim&quot;, which word is sometimes used of civil magistrates, sometimes of angels, and sometimes of God himself, and of the divine Persons in the Godhead: the Targum of Onkelos seems to respect the former, rendering it &quot;as great personages&quot;, princes, judges, civil magistrates, who ought to know the difference between good and evil, or otherwise would be unfit for their office; but this cannot be the sense here, since there were no such persons in being, to whom the reference could be made; nor could it convey any proper idea to the mind of Eve, unless by them are meant principalities and powers, or &quot;the mighty angels&quot;, as the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases the word; and so it intimates, that upon eating this fruit they should be as wise and as knowing as those intelligent creatures: though perhaps Satan might mean, such angels as himself and his were, and that they should by sad experience know the difference between good and evil, as they did: but rather it is to be understood of that Elohim that made the heavens and the earth, for as yet the word had never been used, but of the true God, and of the divine Persons in the Trinity: and this agrees with what is ironically said, Genesis 3:22   &quot;behold the man is become as one of us&quot;, as the devil told him he should, and as he believed he would: this was the bait laid for than, suited to his intellectual mind, and to the ambitious desires of it, not being content with finite knowledge, but aiming at omniscience, or something like it: now the temptation began to take place and operate. </p>

<p>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food ,.... She being near the tree, and perhaps just at it when the serpent first attacked her; wherefore looking more wishfully at it, she could discern nothing in the fruit of the tree which showed it to be bad, and unfit to be eaten, or why it should be forbidden for food; but, on the contrary, had a most promising aspect to be very delicious, nourishing and salutary, as any other fruit in the garden: </p>
<p> and that it was pleasant to the eyes ; of a beautiful colour, and very inviting to the taste: </p>
<p> and a tree to be desired to make one wise ; which above all was the most engaging, and was the most prevailing motive to influence her to eat of it, an eager desire of more wisdom and knowledge; though there was nothing she could see in the tree, and the fruit of it, which promised this; only she perceived in her mind, by the discourse she had with the serpent, and by what he had told her, and she believed, that this would be the consequence of eating this fruit, which was very desirable, and she concluded within herself that so it would be: </p>
<p> she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat ; she took it off of the tree, and not only tasted of it, but ate of it; what quantity cannot be said, enough to break the divine law, and to incur the divine displeasure: so Sanchoniatho saysF12Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 1. p. 34. , that Aeon (the same with Eve) found the way of taking food from trees: </p>
<p> and gave also to her husband with her ; that he might eat as well as she, and partake of the same benefits and advantages she hoped to reap from hence; for no doubt it was of good will, and not ill will, that she gave it to him; and when she offered it to him, it is highly probable she made use of arguments with him, and pressed him hard to it, telling him what delicious food it was, as well as how useful it would be to him and her. The Jews infer from hence, that Adam was with her all the while, and heard the discourse between the serpent and her, yet did not interpose nor dissuade his wife from eating the fruit, and being prevailed upon by the arguments used; or however through a strong affection for his wife, that she might not die alone, he did as she had done: </p>
<p> and he did eat ; on which an emphasis may be observed, for it was upon his eating the fate of his posterity depended; for not the woman but the man was the federal head, and he sinning, all his posterity sinned in him, and died in him; through this offence judgment came upon all to condemnation; all became sinners, and obnoxious to death, Romans 5:12 . If Eve only had eaten of the forbidden fruit, it could only have personally affected herself, and she only would have died; and had this been the case, God would have formed another woman for Adam, for the propagation of mankind, had he stood; though since he fell as well as she, it is needless to inquire, and may seem too bold to say what otherwise would have been the case. </p>

<p>And the eyes of them both were opened ,.... Not of their bodies, but of their minds; not so as to have an advanced knowledge of things pleasant, profitable, and useful, as was promised and expected, but of things very disagreeable and distressing. Their eyes were opened to see that they had been deceived by the serpent, that they had broke the commandment of God, and incurred the displeasure of their Creator and kind benefactor, and had brought ruin and destruction upon themselves; they saw what blessings and privileges they had lost, communion with God, the dominion of the creatures, the purity and holiness of their nature, and what miseries they had involved themselves and their posterity in; how exposed they were to the wrath of God, the curse of the law, and to eternal death: </p>
<p> and they knew that they were naked ; they must know before that they were naked in their bodies, but they did not perceive that their nakedness was at all uncomely, or any disadvantage to them; but now they were sensible of both, that whereas they could look upon it before, and not blush or feel any sinful emotions in them, now they could not behold it without shame, and without finding evil concupiscence arising in them; and it being now the cool of the day, and their spirits also seized with fear of the divine displeasure, they might feel a shivering all over them, and wanted something to cover them: but more especially this may respect the nakedness of their souls they were now conscious of, being stripped of that honour and glory, privileges and power, they were vested with; and having lost the image of God that was upon them, and that robe of purity, innocence, and righteousness, the rectitude of their nature, with which they were arrayed, and finding themselves naked and defenceless, and unable to screen themselves from the curses of a righteous law, and the fury of vindictive justice: </p>
<p> and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons ; not to cover their whole bodies, but only those parts which, ever since, mankind have been ashamed to expose to public view, and which they studiously conceal from sight: the reason of which perhaps is, because by those members the original corruption of human nature has been from the beginning, and still is propagated from parents to children. The leaves of the fig tree were pitched upon because of the largeness of them; the leaves of the common fig tree are very large, as everyone knows; and perhaps those in the eastern countries, and especially in paradise, were much larger than ours. PlinyF13Nat. Hist. l. 16. c. 26.  says of the fig tree, that its leaf is the largest, and the most shady. Some think the Indian fig tree is meant; so John Temporarius, as Drusius relates; and so our MiltonF14----There soon they chose The fig tree; not that kind for fruit renowned, But such as at this day in India known. Paradise Lost, B. 9. l. 1100, &c. ; and according to PlinyF15Nat. Hist. l. 12. c. 5. , the breadth of the leaves of this tree has the shape of an Amazonian shield. And when they are said to sew these together, it is not to be supposed that they sewed them as tailors sew their garments together, since they cannot be thought to be furnished with proper instruments, or that they tacked them together with some sort of thorns, or made use of them instead of needles; but they took the tender branches of the fig tree with leaves on them, as the word signifies, see Nehemiah 8:15   and twisted them round their waists; which served for &quot;girdles&quot;, as some render the wordF16&#1495;&#1490;&#1512;&#1514; ,    &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#950;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; , Sept. &quot;perizomata&quot;, V.

<p>And the Lord God called unto Adam ,.... The Jerusalem Targum is, the Word of the Lord God, the second Person in the Trinity; and this is the voice he is said to have heard before: </p>
<p> and said unto him, where art thou ? which is said, not as ignorant of the place where he was, nor of what he had done, nor of the circumstances he was in, or of the answers he would make; but rather it shows all the reverse, that he knew where he was, what he had done, and in what condition he was, and therefore it was in vain to seek to hide himself: or as pitying his case, saying, &quot;alas for thee&quot;F21&#1488;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492; , &quot;hei tibi&quot;, Oleaster. , as some render the words, into what a miserable plight hast thou brought thyself, by listening to the tempter, and disobeying thy God! thou that wast the favourite of heaven, the chief of the creatures, the inhabitant of Eden, possessed of all desirable bliss and happiness, but now in the most wretched and forlorn condition imaginable; or as upbraiding him with his sin and folly; that he who had been so highly favoured by him, as to be made after his image and likeness, to have all creatures at his command, and the most delightful spot in all the globe to dwell in, and a grant to eat of what fruit he would, save one, and who was indulged with intercourse with his God, and with the holy angels, should act such an ungrateful part as to rebel against him, break his laws, and trample upon his legislative authority, and bid, as it were, defiance to him: or else as the Saviour, looking up his straying sheep, and lost creature, man: or rather as a summons to appear before him, the Judge of all, and answer for his conduct; it was in vain for him to secrete himself, he must and should appear; the force of which words he felt, and therefore was obliged to surrender himself, as appears from what follows. </p>

<p>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden ,.... The voice of thy Word, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan: this was not the true cause of his hiding himself; he had heard his voice in the garden before, when it did not strike him with terror, but gave him pleasure: </p>
<p> and I was afraid, because I was naked . This also was not the true reason; he was naked from his creation as to his body, and it caused no shame in him, nor any dread to appear before God; he conceals the true cause, which was sin, that made the nakedness of his body shameful, and had stripped his soul of its native clothing, purity and holiness; and therefore it was, he could not appear before a pure and holy Being: </p>
<p> and I hid myself ; among the trees of the garden, and his wife also; or thereforeF23&#1493;   &quot;ldeo&quot;, Vatablus.  &quot;hid myself&quot;; through fear of God, his wrath and displeasure, which he had justly incurred by his disobedience, and because of his sin which had made his soul naked, though he was not as yet ingenuous enough to confess it. </p>

<p>And he said ,.... The Lord God, or the Word of the Lord: </p>
<p> who told thee that thou wast naked ? or showed it to thee; by what means hast thou got knowledge of it? what hast thou done that thou perceivest it, so as to cause shame and fear? man was made naked, and so he continued, and he must be sensible of it, but it gave him no uneasiness, because he was without shame on account of it; so that it was as if it was not, and he was regardless of it, as if he was not naked; but now, having sinned, he could not look upon his nakedness without blushing, and sin being what had produced this sensation, he was afraid to appear before God, against whom he had sinned; though he did not choose to acknowledge it, only alleges his outward nakedness, without confessing the inward nakedness of his soul, and being humbled for that as he ought to have been; and in order to bring him to this, is this question and the following put unto him: </p>
<p> hast thou eaten of the tree, wherever I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ? The Lord knew he had; but he puts this question to bring him to a confession of it, as well as to aggravate his crime; that it was a violation of a precept of his, who had been so kind and bountiful to him, who had crowned him with glory and honour, and set him over the works of his hands, and had put all creatures under his feet, and had allowed him to eat of every tree in the garden but one; there was but one tree restrained from him, but one command he gave him, and this he broke; sin is a transgression of the law, 1 John 3:4 . And in this light it is here put to bring Adam under a conviction, and to a confession of it; though he made it in a very lame manner, having covered it as long as he could; being found he excuses it, as loath to bear the blame and scandal of it.

<p>And the man said ,.... Not being able any longer to conceal the truth, though he shifts off the blame as much as possible from himself: </p>
<p> the woman whom thou gavest to be with me : to be his wife and his companion, to be an help meet unto him, and share with him in the blessings of paradise, to assist in civil and domestic affairs, and join with him in acts of religion and devotion: </p>
<p> she gave me of the tree, and I did eat ; she first ate of it herself, through the solicitations of the serpent, and then she persuaded me to eat of it; and accordingly I did, I own it. By this answer Adam endeavours to cast the blame partly upon his wife, and partly upon God; though in what he said he told the truth, and what was matter of fact, yet it carries this innuendo, that if it had not been for his wife he had never ate of it, which was a foolish excuse; for he, being her head and husband, should have taught her better, and been more careful to have prevented her eating of this fruit, and should have dissuaded her from it, and have reproved her for it, instead of following her example, and taking it from her hands: and more than this he tacitly reflects upon God, that he had given him a woman, who, instead of being an help meet to him, had helped to ruin him; and that if he had not given him this woman, he had never done what he had: but at this rate a man may find fault with God for the greatest blessings and mercies of life bestowed on him, which are abused by him, and so aggravate his condemnation. </p>

<p>And the Lord God said unto the serpent ,.... And to the devil in it; for what follows may be applied to both; literally to the serpent, and mystically to Satan; both are punished, and that very justly, the serpent in being the instrument Satan made use of, and is cursed for his sake, as the earth for man's; and the punishing the instrument as well as the principal, the more discovers God's detestation of the act for which they are punished, as appears in other instances, Exodus 21:28 . Nor could it have been agreeable to the justice of God, to punish the instrument and let the principal go free; and therefore the following sentence must be considered as respecting them both: and it must be observed, that no pains is taken to convince Satan of his sin, or any time spent in reasoning and debating with him about it, he being an hardened apostate spirit, and doomed to everlasting destruction, and without any hope of mercy and forgiveness; but to show the divine resentment of his crime, the following things are said: </p>
<p> because thou hast done this ; beguiled the woman, and drawn her in to eat of the forbidden fruit: </p>
<p> thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field ; the serpent is the most hateful of all creatures, and especially the most detestable to men, and Satan is accursed of God, banished from the divine presence, is laid up in chains of darkness, and reserved for the judgment of the great day, and consigned to everlasting wrath and ruin, signified by everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: </p>
<p> upon thy belly shalt thou go , or &quot;breast&quot;, as Aben Ezra, and others; Jarchi thinks it had feet before, but were cut off on this account, and so became a reptile, as some serpents now have feet like geese, as PlinyF24Nat. Hist. l. 11. c. 47.  relates; or it might go in a more erect posture on its hinder feet, as the basilisk, which is one kind of serpent, now does; and if it was a flying one, bright and shining in the air, now it should lose all its glory, and grovel in the dust, and with pain, or at least with difficulty, creep along on its breast and belly; and this, as it respects the punishment of the devil, may signify, that he being cast down from the realms of bliss and glory, shall never be able to rise more, and regain his former place and dignity: </p>
<p> And dust shall thou eat all the days of thy life ; meaning not that particular serpent, and as long as that should live, but all of the same kind, as long as there were any in the world, even to the end of it: it is probable, that when the serpent moved in a more erect posture, it lived on herbs and plants as other creatures; but when it was obliged to go upon its belly or breast, it licked up the dust of the earth, and which it could not well avoid in eating whatsoever food it did; and some serpents are said to live upon it. This is applicable to Satan, designs the mean and abject condition in which he is, and the sordid food he lives upon; no more on angels' food and joys of heaven, but on the base, mean, earthly, and impure lusts of men; and this will be his case, condition, and circumstances, for ever. </p>

<p>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman ,.... Between whom there had been so much familiarity, not only while they had the preceding discourse together, but before; for it is conjectured by someF25See the Universal History, vol. 1. p. 126. , that she took a particular liking to that creature, and was delighted with it, and laid it perhaps in her bosom, adorned her neck with its windings, or made it a bracelet for her arms; and being a peculiar favourite, the devil made choice of it as his instrument to deceive her; but now being beguiled hereby, she conceived an antipathy against it, and which is become natural between the serpent and man; man abhors the sight of a serpent, and the serpent the sight of man; and the spittle of a man and the gall of a serpent are poison to each other; and this antipathy is observed to be stronger in the female sex: and this was not only true of the particular serpent that deceived Eve, and of the particular woman, Eve, deceived by him, but of every serpent and of every woman in successive ages; and is also true of Satan and the church of God in all ages, between whom there is an implacable and an irreconcilable hatred, and a perpetual war: </p>
<p> and between thy seed and her seed ; the posterity of Eve, mankind, and the production of serpents, between whom the antipathy still continues, and mystically the evil angels and also wicked men called serpents; and a generation of vipers on the one hand, and the people of God on the other, the seed of the church; the latter of which are hated and persecuted by the former, and so it has been ever since this affair happened: and especially by the seed of the woman may be meant the Messiah; the word &quot;seed&quot; sometimes signifying a single person, Genesis 4:25   and particularly Christ, Galatians 3:16   and he may with great propriety be so called, because he was made of a woman and not begotten by man; and who assumed not an human person, but an human nature, which is called the &quot;holy thing&quot;, and the &quot;seed of Abraham&quot;, as here the &quot;seed of the woman&quot;, as well as it expresses the truth of his incarnation and the reality of his being man; and who as he has been implacably hated by Satan and his angels, and by wicked men, so he has opposed himself to all them that hate and persecute his people: </p>
<p> it shall bruise thy head ; the head of a serpent creeping on the ground is easily crushed and bruised, of which it is sensible, and therefore it is careful to hide and cover it. In the mystical sense, &quot;it&quot;, or &quot;he, Hu&quot;, which is one of the names of God, Psalm 102:27   and here of the Messiah, the eminent seed of the woman, should bruise the head of the old serpent the devil, that is, destroy him and all his principalities and powers, break and confound all his schemes, and ruin all his works, crush his whole empire, strip him of his authority and sovereignty, and particularly of his power over death, and his tyranny over the bodies and souls of men; all which was done by Christ, when he became incarnate and suffered and died, Hebrews 2:14 . </p>
<p> And thou shall bruise his heel ; the heel of a man being what the serpent can most easily come at, as at the heels of horses which it bites, Genesis 49:17   and which agrees with that insidious creature, as AristotleF26Hist. Animal. l. 1. c. 1.  describes it: this, as it refers to the devil, may relate to the persecutions of the members of Christ on earth, instigated by Satan, or to some slight trouble he should receive from him in the days of his flesh, by his temptations in the wilderness, and agony with him in the garden; or rather by the heel of Christ is meant his human nature, which is his inferior and lowest nature, and who was in it frequently exposed to the insults, temptations, and persecutions of Satan, and was at last brought to a painful and accursed death; though by dying he got an entire victory over him and all his enemies, and obtained salvation for his people. The Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase this passage of the days of the Messiah, and of health and salvation in them: what is here delivered out in a way of threatening to the serpent the devil, carries in it a kind intimation of grace and good will to fallen man, and laid a foundation for hope of salvation and happiness: reference seems to be had to this passage in Psalm 40:7   &quot;in the volume&quot;, in the first roll,    &#949;&#957; &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#948;&#953; , as in the Greek version, at the head, in the beginning &quot;of the book, it is written of me, to do thy will, O my God.&quot; </p>

<p> in sorrow shall thou bring forth children , sons and daughters, with many severe pangs and sharp pains, which are so very acute, that great tribulations and afflictions are often in Scripture set forth by them: and it is remarked by naturalistsF4Aristotel. Hist. Animal. l. 7. c. 9. , that women bring forth their young with more pain than any other creature: </p>
<p> and thy desire shall be to thy husband , which some understand of her desire to the use of the marriage bed, as Jarchi, and even notwithstanding her sorrows and pains in child bearing; but rather this is to be understood of her being solely at the will and pleasure of her husband; that whatever she desired should be referred to him, whether she should have her desire or not, or the thing she desired; it should be liable to be controlled by his will, which must determine it, and to which she must be subject, as follows: </p>
<p> and he shall rule over thee , with less kindness and gentleness, with more rigour and strictness: it looks as if before the transgression there was a greater equality between the man and the woman, or man did not exercise the authority over the woman he afterwards did, or the subjection of her to him was more pleasant and agreeable than now it would be; and this was her chastisement, because she did not ask advice of her husband about eating the fruit, but did it of herself, without his will and consent, and tempted him to do the same. </p>

<p>And unto Adam he said ,.... Last of all, being the last that sinned, but not to be excused: </p>
<p> because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife ; which was not only mean but sinful, since it was opposite to the voice of God, which he ought to have hearkened to God is to be hearkened to and obeyed rather than man, and much rather than a woman; to regard the persuasion of a woman, and neglect the command of God, is a great aggravation of such neglect; see Acts 4:19 . </p>
<p> and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee; saying, thou shall not eat of it ; that is, had eat of the fruit of the tree which God had plainly pointed unto him, and concerning which he had given a clear and an express command not to eat of it; and had delivered it to him in the strongest manner, and had most peremptorily and strictly enjoined it, adding the threatening of death unto it; so that he could by no means plead ignorance in himself, or any obscurity in the law, or pretend he did not understand the sense of the legislator. The righteous sentence therefore follows: </p>
<p> cursed is the ground for thy sake ; the whole earth, which was made for man, and all things in it, of which he had the possession and dominion, and might have enjoyed the use of everything in it, with comfort and pleasure; that which was man's greatest earthly blessing is now turned into a curse by sin, which is a proof of the exceeding sinfulness of it, and its just demerit: so in later instances, a &quot;fruitful land&quot; is turned &quot;into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein&quot;, Psalm 107:34   hence, whenever there is sterility in a country, a want of provisions, a famine, it should always be imputed to sin; and this should put us in mind of the sin of the first man, and the consequence of that: </p>
<p> in sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of thy life , meaning that with much toil and trouble, in manuring and cultivating the earth, he should get his living out of the produce of it, though with great difficulty; and this would be his case as long as he was in it. </p>

<p> for dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return ; his body was composed of the dust, was of the earth, earthly, and should be reduced to that again by death, which is not an annihilation of man, but a bringing him back to his original; which shows what a frail creature man is, what little reason he has to be proud of himself, when he reflects from whence he came and whither he must go; see Ecclesiastes 12:7 . </p>

<p>And Adam called his wife's name Eve ,.... Whom he had before named &quot;Ishah&quot;, a woman, because taken from him the man, Genesis 2:23   and now gives her a new name upon this scene of things, which had taken place; which is derived not from &quot;Chavah&quot;, to &quot;show forth&quot;, to &quot;declare&quot;; as if she was called so, because of her discourse with the serpent, being loquacious and talkative, and telling everything she knew, according to some Jewish writersF7Apud Fagium in loc. vid. Baal Hatturim in loc. ; but from &quot;Chayah, to live&quot;, as the reason given in the text shows. She is called Aeon &quot;(Aevum)&quot; by Philo Byblius, the interpreter of SanchoniathoF8Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 1. p. 34. . The word &quot;Eve&quot; is retained in many Heathen writers, and used to be frequently repeated in the Bacchanalian rites, when the idolaters appeared with serpents platted on their headsF9Virgil. Aeneid. l. 6. v. 518, 519. Pers. Satyr 1. v. 101, 102. vid. Clement. Alex. ad Gentes, p. 9. ; which plainly refers to the affair between the serpent and Eve; hence Bacchus is sometimes called EviusF11Horat. Carmin. l. 2. ode 11. v. 17. : the reason of Adam's giving her this name follows: </p>
<p> because she was the mother of all living ; which reason is either given by Moses, when from her had sprung a numerous offspring, and would be continued to the end of the world; or if given by Adam was prophetic of what she would be; and so the Vulgate Latin version renders it, &quot;because she would be the mother of all living&quot;; and the ground of this faith and persuasion of his, that he and his wife should not die immediately for the offence they had committed, but should live and propagate their species, as well as be partakers of spiritual and eternal life, was the hint that had been just given, that there would be a seed spring from them; not only a numerous offspring, but a particular eminent person that should be the ruin of the devil and his kingdom, and the Saviour of them; and so Eve would be not, only the mother of all men living in succeeding generations, but particularly, or however one descending from her, would be the mother of him that should bring life and immortality to light, or be the author of all life, natural, spiritual, and eternal; and who is called    &#950;&#969;&#951; , &quot;the life&quot;, which is the same word by which the Greek version renders Eve in the preceding clause. It was with pleasure, no doubt, that Adam gave her this name; and it appears that this affair of her being seduced by the serpent, and of drawing him into the transgression, did not alienate his affection from her; and the rather he must needs cleave unto her, and not forsake her, since her seed was to break the serpent's head, and procure life and salvation for them; and by means of her there would be a race of living men produced, which would propagate his species to the end of time: for all living can only respect them, and not other animals, though in some sense they may be included, as our English poetF12Mother of all things living, since by thee Man is to live, and all things live for man.

The Heathens had a notion, that the first men made themselves coats of the skins of beasts: the Grecians ascribe this to Pelasgus, whom they suppose to be the first manF13Pausanias in Arcadicis, sive, l. 8. p. 455,456.  among them, and SanchoniathoF14Apud Euseb.

<p> behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil ; which is generally understood as an irony or sarcasm at man's deception by Satan, who promised man, and he expected to be as gods, knowing good and evil; behold the man, see how much like a god he looks, with his coat of skin upon his back, filled with shame and confusion for his folly, and dejected under a sense of what he had lost, and in a view of what he was sentenced to; yet must be understood not as rejoicing in man's misery, and insulting over him in it, but in order the more to convince him of his folly, and the more to humble him, and bring him to a more open repentance for affecting what he did, and giving credit to the devil in it: though I rather think they are seriously spoken, since this was after man was brought to a sense of the evil he committed, and to repentance for it, and had had the promised seed revealed to him as a Saviour, and, as an emblem of justification and salvation by him, was clothed with garments provided by God himself: wherefore the words are to be considered either as a declaration of his present state and condition, in and by Christ, by whose righteousness he was made righteous, even as he is righteous, though he had lost his own; to whose image he was conformed, now bearing the image of the heavenly One, though he was deprived of that in which he was created, having sinned, and come short of the glory of God; and was now restored to friendship and amity with God, favoured with his gracious presence, and having faith and hope of being with him for evermore; the eyes of his understanding were enlightened by the Spirit and grace of God, to know the good things which God had provided for him in Christ, and in the covenant of grace, a better covenant than that under which he was made, and which he had broke; and to know the evil nature of sin, its just demerit, and the atonement of it, by the death and sacrifice of the promised seed: or else the words are a declaration of man's past state and condition, and may be rendered, &quot;behold, the man was as one of us&quot;F15&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;   &quot;fuit&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, Schmidt. So Abarbinel. apud Abendana in Miclol. Yophi in loc. ; as one of the Persons in the Deity, as the Son of God, after whose image, and in whose likeness, he was made; both as to his body, that being formed according to the idea of the body of Christ in the divine mind, and which was not begotten, but made out of the virgin earth; and as to his soul, which was created in righteousness and holiness, in wisdom and knowledge, and was like him in the government he had over all the creatures: and besides, he was in many things a type of Christ, a figure of him that was to come; especially in his being a federal head to his posterity, and in his offices of prophet, priest, and King; and being created in knowledge, after the image of him that created him, and having the law of God inscribed on his heart, he knew what was good and to be done, and what was evil and to be avoided: but now he was in a different condition, in other circumstances, had lost the image of God, and friendship with him, and his government over the creatures; and had ruined himself, and all his posterity, and was become unholy and unwise; for being tempted by Satan to eat of the forbidden fruit, under an expectation of increasing his knowledge, lost in a great measure what he had: </p>
<p> and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life ; as well as of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; which some take to be a continued sarcasm; and others, that it was in pity to him, that he might not live a long life of sorrow; and others, as a punishment, that having sinned he was justly deprived of the sacrament and symbol of life; or else to prevent a fresh sin; or rather to show that there could be no life without satisfaction for the sin committed, and this in no other way than by Christ, the antitype of the tree of life: </p>
<p> and eat, and live for ever ; not that it was possible, by eating of the fruit of the tree of life, his natural life could be continued for ever, contrary to the sentence of death pronounced upon him; or so as to elude that sentence, and by it eternal life be procured and obtained; but he was hindered from eating of it, lest he should flatter himself, that by so doing he should live for ever, notwithstanding he was doomed to die; and very probably the devil had suggested this to him, that should he be threatened with death, which he made a question of, yet by eating of the tree of life, which stood just by the other, he might save himself from dying: wherefore to prevent him, and to cut off all hopes of securing life to himself in this way, it is suggested that something must be done, which may be supplied from the following verse, let us send him out of the garden. </p>

<p>Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden ,.... Gave him orders to depart immediately; sent or put him away as a man does his wife, when he divorces her; or as a prince banishes a rebellious subject: for how long Adam was in the garden see Gill on Psalm 49:12 , however, he did not send him to hell at once, as he did the apostate angels, but </p>
<p> to till the ground, from whence he was taken : either the earth in general, out of which he was made, and to which he must return, and in the mean while must labour hard, in digging and ploughing, in planting and sowing, that so he might get a livelihood; or that particular spot out of which he was formed, which is supposed from hence to have been without the garden of Eden, though very probably near unto it: some say it was a field near Damascus; the Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;he went and dwelt in Mount Moriah, to till the ground out of which he was created;'and so other Jewish writers sayF16Pirke Eliezer, c. 20. fol. 20. 2. , the gate of paradise was near Mount Moriah, and there Adam dwelt after he was cast out. </p>

<p>So he drove out the man ,.... Being unwilling to go out upon the orders given, some degree of force was used, or power exerted, in some way or other, to oblige him to depart; the word it is expressed by is used of divorces: there was a conjugal relation between God and man, the covenant between them had the nature of a matrimonial contract; which covenant man broke, though he was an husband to him, by committing idolatry, that is, spiritual adultery, not giving credit to him, but believing the devil before him; wherefore he wrote him a bill of divorce, and sent him away; drove him from his presence and communion with him, from his house and habitation, from his seat of pleasure, and garden of delight, and from all the comfortable enjoyments of life; an emblem of that separation and distance which sin makes between God and his creature, and of that loss which is sustained thereby: </p>
<p> and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden, cherubims ; the Septuagint version is,&quot;and he placed him, or caused him (Adam) to dwell over against the paradise of pleasure, and he ordered the cherubim'But the words are not to be understood either of placing man, or placing the cherubim, but of Jehovah's placing himself, or taking up his habitation and residence before the garden of Eden, or at the east of it: while man abode in a state of innocence, the place of the divine Presence, or where God more gloriously manifested himself to him, was in the garden; but now he having sinned, and being driven out of it, he fixes his abode in a very awful manner at the entrance of the garden, to keep man out of it; for so the words may be rendered, &quot;and he inhabited the cherubim, or dwelt over, or between the cherubim, before or at the east of the garden of Eden&quot;F17&#1488;&#1514;  &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;--&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1499;&#1503;   &quot;et habitavit super `seu' cum cherubim&quot;, Texelii Phoenix, p. 256. So &#1488;&#1514;   sometimes signifies &quot;upon&quot;, &quot;above&quot;, or &quot;with&quot;. See Nold. Ebr. part. Concord. p. 116, 121. ; so the Jerusalem Targum,&quot;and he made the glory of his Shechinah, or glorious Majesty, to dwell of old at the east of the garden of Eden, over or above the two cherubim;'or between them, as the Targum of Jonathan; and very frequently is Jehovah described as sitting and dwelling between the cherubim, 1 Samuel 4:4   by which are meant not flying animals or fowls, whose form no man ever saw, as JosephusF18Antiqu. l. 3. c. 6. sect. 6. ; nor angels, which is the more generally received opinion; for these were not real living creatures of any sort, but forms and representations, such as were made afterwards in the tabernacle of Moses, and temple of Solomon; and which Ezekiel and John saw in a visionary way, and from whom we learn what figures they were: and these were hieroglyphics, not of a trinity of persons, as some of late have stupidly imagined; for these were the seat of the divine Majesty, and between which he dwelt: and besides, as these had four faces, they would rather represent a quaternity than a trinity, and would give a similitude of the divine Being, which cannot be done, and be contrary to the second command; to which may be added, that the word is sometimes singular as well as plural: but these were hieroglyphics of the ministers of the word, whose understanding, humility, and tenderness, are signified by the face of a man; their strength, courage, and boldness, by that of a lion; their labour and diligence by that of an ox; and their quick sight and penetration into divine things by that of an eagle, which are the forms and figures of the cherubim; see Gill on Ezekiel 1:10 . Among these Jehovah is; with these he grants his presence, and by them signifies his mind and will to men; and these he makes use of to show them the vanity of all self-confidence, and to beat them off of seeking for life and righteousness by their own works, and to direct them alone to Christ, and point him out as the alone way of salvation; and of this use the hieroglyphic might be to fallen Adam, now driven out of Eden: </p>
<p> and a flaming sword, which turned every way ; a drawn sword, brandished, and which being very quick in its motion, as it was turned to and fro, glittered and looked like a flame of fire: this is not to be understood as by itself, and as of itself, turning about every way without a hand to move it, nor as with the cherubim, or as in the hands of angels, as in 1 Chronicles 21:16   or as being they themselves, which are made as flames of fire; but as in the hand of the Lord God, that dwelt between the cherubim; for so it may be rendered, &quot;he inhabited the cherubim and that with a flaming sword&quot;F19&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;  &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;  &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;   &quot;idque cum gladio evaginato&quot;, Texelius, ib. ; that is, with one in his hand, an emblem of the fiery law of God now broken, and of the fire of divine wrath on the account of that, and of the flaming justice of God, which required satisfaction; and this turning on all sides: </p>
<p> to keep the way of the tree of life ; showing, that life and salvation were not to be had, unless the law and justice of God were satisfied; and that they were not to be expected on the foot of men's works, but only through Christ, the way, the truth, and the life; that no happiness was to be looked for from the covenant of works, now broke, nothing but wrath and vengeance; and that there must be another way opened, or there could be no enjoyment of the heavenly paradise. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 4  </p>
<p> In this chapter an account is given of the two eldest children of Adam and Eve, their names and calling, Genesis 4:1   and of their different offerings to the Lord, and the different respect had unto them by him, which in Cain issued in wrath and envy, which appeared in his countenance, and were taken notice of by the Lord, and about which he reasoned with him, Genesis 4:3   but it had no effect upon him, he murdered his brother, upon which he was examined about him, but denied he knew anything of him where he was, Genesis 4:8   he is arraigned, convicted and condemned, sentence passed upon him, and that executed, which he complains of, and is mitigated, or however a protection is granted him, and a mark set on him for his security, Genesis 4:10   after which we have an account of his posterity for several generations, their names, and the business of some of them, Genesis 4:16   and the chapter is closed with the birth of another son, and of a grandson to Adam and Eve, in whose days was the beginning of social religion. </p>

<p>And Adam knew Eve his wife ,.... An euphemism, or modest expression of the act of coition. Jarchi interprets it, &quot;had known&quot;, even before he sinned, and was drove out of the garden; and so other Jewish writers, who think he otherwise would not have observed the command, &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot;: but if Adam had begotten children in a state of innocence, they would have been free from sin, and not tainted with the corruption of nature after contracted; but others more probably think it was some considerable time after; according to Mer Thudiusi, or TheodosiusF20Apud Abulpharag. Hist. Dynast. p. 6. , it was thirty years after he was driven out of paradise: </p>
<p> and she conceived and bare Cain ; in the ordinary way and manner, as women ever since have usually done, going the same time with her burden. Whether this name was given to her first born by her, or by her husband, or both, is not said: it seems to have been given by her, from the reason of it after assigned. His name, in Philo BybliusF21Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 1. c. 10. p. 34. , is Genos, which no doubt was Cain, in Sanchoniatho, whom he translated; and his wife, or the twin born with him, is said to be Genea, that is, &#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; , &quot;Cainah&quot;: the Arabs call her ClimiahF22Abulpharag. ib.  and the Jewish writers KalmenahF23Shalshaleth Hakabala, fol. 74. 2. ; who are generally of opinion, that with Cain and Abel were born twin sisters, which became their wives. </p>
<p> And said , that is, Eve said upon the birth of her firstborn: </p>
<p> I have gotten a man from the Lord ; as a gift and blessing from him, as children are; or by him, by his favour and good will; and through his blessing upon her, causing her to conceive and bear and bring forth a son: some render it, &quot;I have gotten a man, the Lord&quot;F24&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;  &#1488;&#1514;  &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;   &quot;virum Dominum&quot;, Fagius, Helvicus, Forster, Schindler, Luther, Pellican, Cocceius; &quot;virum qui Jehovah est&quot;, Schmidt. ; that promised seed that should break the serpents head; by which it would appear, that she took that seed to be a divine person, the true God, even Jehovah, that should become man; though she must have been ignorant of the mystery of his incarnation, or of his taking flesh of a virgin, since she conceived and bare Cain through her husband's knowledge of her: however, having imbibed this notion, it is no wonder she should call him Cain, a possession or inheritance; since had this been the case, she had got a goodly one indeed: but in this she was sadly mistaken, he proved not only to be a mere man, but to be a very bad man: the Targum of Jonathan favours this sense, rendering the words,&quot;I have gotten a man, the angel of the Lord.' </p>

<p>And she again bare his brother Abel ,....

(Hist. Dynast. p. 6.)  call Lebuda: the name of Abel, or rather Hebel, signifies not &quot;mourning&quot;, as JosephusF2Antiqu. l. 1. c. 2. sect. 1.  observes, but &quot;vanity&quot;, Eve not making that account of him as she did of Cain; or perhaps because by this time she became sensible of her mistake in him, or had met with something which convinced her that all earthly enjoyments were vanity; or by a spirit of prophecy foresaw what would befall this her second son, that he should be very early deprived of his life in a violent manner: </p>
<p> and Abel was a keeper of sheep : a calling which he either chose himself, or his father put him to, and gave him; for though he and his brother were born to a large estate, being the heirs of Adam, the lord of the whole earth, yet they were not brought up in idleness, but in useful and laborious employments: </p>
<p> but Cain was a tiller of the ground : of the same occupation his father was, and he being the first born, was brought up in the same business, and might be a reason why he was put into it. </p>

<p>And in process of time it came to pass ,.... Or &quot;at the end of days&quot;F3&#1502;&#1511;&#1509;  &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;   &quot;in fine dierum&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus; &quot;a fine dierum&quot;, Schmidt. ; which some understand of the end of seven days, at the end of the week, or on the seventh day, which they suppose to be the sabbath day, these sons of Adam brought their offerings to the Lord: but this proceeds upon an hypothesis not sufficiently established, that the seventh day sabbath was now appointed to be observed in a religious way; rather, according to Aben Ezra, it was at the end of the year; So &quot;after days&quot; in Judges 11:4   is meant after a year; and which we there render, as here, &quot;in process of time&quot;. This might be after harvest, after the fruits of the earth were gathered in, and so a proper season to bring an offering to the Lord, in gratitude for the plenty of good things they had been favoured with; as in later times, with the Israelites, there was a feast for the ingathering of the fruits of the earth, Exodus 23:16 . The Targum of Jonathan fixes this time to the fourteenth of Nisan, as if it was the time of the passover, a feast instituted two thousand years after this time, or thereabout; and very stupidly one of the Jewish writersF4Pirke Eliezer, c. 21.  observes, that&quot;the night of the feast of the passover came, and Adam said to his sons, on this night the Israelites will bring the offerings of the passovers, offer ye also before your Creator.&quot; </p>
<p> That Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord ; corn, herbs, seeds, &c. the Targum of Jonathan says it was flax seed; so Jarchi makes mention of an &quot;agadah&quot; or exposition, which gives the same sense; and another of their writersF5Ib. Vid. Tzeror Hammor, fol. 8. 2.  observes, that Cain brought what was left of his food, or light and trifling things, flax or hemp seed. This he brought either to his father, as some think, being priest in his family; or rather he brought and offered it himself at the place appointed for religious worship, and for sacrifices; so Aben Ezra, he brought it to the place fixed for his oratory. It is highly probable it was at the east of the entrance of the garden of Eden, where the Shechinah, or the divine Majesty, was, and appeared in some remarkable manner. </p>

<p>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock ,.... As he was a shepherd, his flock consisted of sheep; and of the firstlings of these, the lambs that were first brought forth, he presented as an offering to the Lord; and which were afterwards frequently used in sacrifice, and were a proper type of Christ, Jehovah's firstborn, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world, a Lamb without spot and blemish; fitly signified by one for his innocence, harmlessness, and meekness: </p>
<p> and of the fat thereof ; which is to be understood either of the fat properly, which in later time was claimed by the Lord as his own, Leviticus 3:16   or of the fattest of his flock, the best lambs he had; the fattest and plumpest, and which were most free from defects and blemishes; not the torn, nor lame, nor sick, but that which was perfect and without spot; for God is to be served with the best we have. JosephusF6Antiqu. l. 1. c. 2. sect. 1.  says it was milk, and the firstlings of his flock; and a word of the same letters, differently pointed, signifies milk; and some learned men, as Grotius and others, have given into this sense, observing it to be a custom with the Egyptians to sacrifice milk to their gods: but the word, as here pointed, is never used for milk; nor were such sacrifices ever used by the people of God; and Abel's sacrifice is called by the apostle    &#952;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954; , a &quot;slain&quot; sacrifice, as HeideggerF7Hist. Patriarch. Exercit. 5. sect. 20.  observes: </p>
<p> and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offering ; as being what he had designed and appointed to be used for sacrifice in future time, and as being a suitable type and emblem of the Messiah, and his sacrifice; and especially as being offered up by faith, in a view to the sacrifice of Christ, which is of a sweet smelling savour to God, and by which sin only is atoned and satisfied for, see Hebrews 11:4 . God looked at his sacrifice with a smiling countenance, took, and expressed delight, well pleasedness, and satisfaction in it; and he first accepted of his person, as considered in Christ his well beloved Son, and then his offering in virtue of his sacrifice: and this respect and acceptance might be signified by some visible sign or token, and particularly by the descent of fire from heaven upon it, as was the token of acceptance in later times, Leviticus 9:24   and Theodotion here renders it, he &quot;fired&quot; it, or &quot;set&quot; it on &quot;fire&quot;; and Jarchi paraphrases it,&quot;fire descended and licked up his offering;'and Aben Ezra,&quot;and fire descended and reduced the offering of Abel to ashes;'so Abraham SebaF8In Tzeror Hammor, fol. 8. 2. . </p>

Not because of the matter of it, as some have thought; but because it was not offered in faith and sincerity, but in a formal and hypocritical manner, without any regard to the Messiah and his sacrifice, and without any view to the glory of God: no notice was taken, no approbation was given of it by the above token, or any other; so that it was manifest to Cain himself, that God did not approve of it, or was well pleased with it, as with his brother's: </p>
<p> and Cain was very wroth ; with God, to whom he offered it, because he did not accept of it, and with his brother, because he and his sacrifice were preferred to him and his: </p>
<p> and his countenance fell ; the briskness and cheerfulness of his countenance went off, and he looked dejected; and instead of lifting up his face towards heaven; he looked with a down look to the earth; he looked churlish, morose, and sullen, ill natured, full of malice and revenge, and as if he was studying which way to vent it; he knit his brows and gnashed his teeth, put on a surly countenance; and there might be seen in his face all the signs, not only of grief and disappointment, but of rage and fury; thoughF9R.

Some render the latter part of the clause, which is but one word in the original text, &quot;there will be a lifting up&quot;F11&#1513;&#1488;&#1514;   &quot;elevare&quot;, Montanus; &quot;erit sublevatio&quot;, Fagius, &quot;elatio&quot;, Drusius, &quot;elevatio erit&quot;, some in Vatablus, Mercerus; so Aben Exra; &quot;remissio&quot;, Junius & Tremellius, Schmidt; &quot;venia erit&quot;, Pagninus; so Ainsworth. ; either of the countenance of the offerer, and so, if Cain had done well, his countenance would not have fallen, but have been lifted up, and cheerful as before; or of sin, which is the pardon of it, and is often expressed by taking and lifting it up, and bearing it away, and so of easing a man of it as of a burden; and in this sense all the Targums take it; which paraphrase it,&quot;it or thy sin shall be forgiven thee:&quot; </p>
<p> and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door ; if thou dost not do good works, nor offer an offering as it should be offered, sin lies at the door of conscience; and as soon as that is awakened and opened, it will enter in and make sad work there, as it afterwards did, Genesis 4:13   or it is open and manifest, and will be taken cognizance of, and punishment be inflicted for it; or else the punishment of sin itself is meant, which lies at the door, is at hand, and will soon be executed; and so all the Targums paraphrase it.&quot;thy sin is reserved to the day of judgment,'or lies at the door of the grave, reserved to that day, as Jarchi. Some render the word a sin offering, as it sometimes signifies; and then the sense is, that though he had sinned, and had done amiss in the offering he had offered, nevertheless there was a propitiatory sacrifice for sin provided, which was at hand, and would soon be offered; so that he had no need to be dejected, or his countenance to fall; for if he looked to that sacrifice by faith, he would find pardon and acceptance; but the former sense is best: </p>
<p> and unto thee shall be his desire ; or &quot;its desire&quot;, as some understand it of sin lying at the door, whose desire was to get in and entice and persuade him to that which was evil, and prevail and rule over him. The Targum of Jonathan, and that of Jerusalem, paraphrase it of sin, but to another sense,&quot;sin shall lie at the door of thine heart, but into thine hand I have delivered the power of the evil concupiscence; and to thee shall be its desire, and thou shalt rule over it, whether to be righteous, or to sin:'but rather it refers to Abel; and the meaning is, that notwithstanding his offering was accepted of God, and not his brother Cain's, this would not alienate his affections from him, nor cause him to refuse subjection to him; but he should still love him as his brother, and be subject to him as his eider brother, and not seek to get from him the birthright, or think that that belonged to him, being forfeited by his brother's sin; and therefore Cain had no reason to be angry with his brother, or envious at him, since this would make no manner of alteration in their civil affairs: </p>
<p> and thou shall rule over him , as thou hast done, being the firstborn. </p>

The Vulgate Latin version adds, &quot;let us go abroad&quot;; and the Septuagint and Samaritan versions, &quot;let us go into the field&quot;; not to fight a duel, which Abel doubtless would have declined, had that been declared, but to have some friendly conversation; and there being a large pause here in the Hebrew text, the Jerusalem Targum gives us an account of what passed between them when in the field;&quot;Cain said to Abel his brother, there is no judgment, nor Judge, nor will a good reward be given to the righteous; nor will vengeance be taken of the wicked; neither is the world created in mercy nor governed in mercy; otherwise, why is thine offering received with good will, and mine not?'Abel answered and said to Cain,&quot;there is a judgment,' &c.and so goes on to assert everything Cain denied, and to give a reason why the offering of the one was accepted, and the other rejected: and to the same purpose the Targum of Jonathan: </p>
<p> and it came to pass, when they were in the field ; alone and at a distance from their parents, or from any town or city, if any were now built, as some think there were, and out of the sight of any person that might come and interpose and rescue: about a mile from Damascus, in a valley, yet on the side of a hill, are now shown the place, or the house on it, where Cain slew AbelF13Lud. Vartoman, Navigat. l. 1. c. 6. ; and so Mr. MaundrelF14Journey from Aleppo, &c. l. 1. p. 131,133,134.  speaks of a high hill near Damascus, reported to be the same they offered their sacrifice on, and Cain slew his brother, and also of another hill at some distance from Damascus, and an ancient structure on it, supposed to be the tomb of Abel: </p>
<p> that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him ; in a furious manner assaulted him, without any just provocation, and took away his life, by some instrument or other, perhaps that was used in husbandry, which might be in the field where they were. The Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;he fixed a stone in his forehead, and slew him;'and so the Jews sayF15Pirke Eliezer, c. 21.  elsewhere: our poetF16-----And, as they talk'd, Smote him into the midriff with a stone, That beat out life.----- Milton's Paradise Lost, B. 11. l. 444, &c.  says, he smote him in the breast with a stone, into the midriff or diaphragm: it must be by some means or other, by which his blood was shed; but it is not material to inquire what the instrument was, as Aben Ezra observes; since though there might be swords, yet there were stones and clubs enough, as he takes notice; and there must be even instruments for agriculture, one of which might be taken up, as being at hand, with which the execution might be made. The Jewish writersF17Josippon apud Abendana in Miclol. Yophi in loc.  say Abel was an hundred years old when he was slain; and some of themF18Tikkune Zohar, correct. 69. fol. 112. l. 2.  make Abel to be the first aggressor: they say, that Abel rose up against him, and threw him to the ground, and afterwards Cain rose up and slew him; however this was not likely the case. </p>

<p>And the Lord said unto Cain, where is Abel thy brother ?.... Perhaps this was said to him the next time he came to offer, he not being with him: this question is put, not as being ignorant where he was, but in order to bring Cain to a conviction and confession of his sin, to touch his conscience with it, and fill it with remorse for it; and, for the aggravation of it, observes the relation of Abel to him, his brother: </p>
<p> and he said, I know not ; which was a downright lie; for he must know where he had left him or laid him: this shows him to be under the influence of Satan, who was a liar, and the father of lies, as well as a murderer from the beginning; and that he was so blinded by him, as to forget whom he was speaking to; that he was the omniscient God, and knew the wickedness he had done, and the falsehood he now delivered, and was capable of confronting him with both, and of inflicting just punishment on him. </p>
<p> Am I my brother's keeper ? which was very saucily and impudently spoken: it is not only put by way of interrogation, but of admiration, as Jarchi observes, as wondering at it, that God should put such a question to him, since he knew he had not the charge of his brother, and his brother was at age to take care of himself; and if not, it rather belonged to God and his providence to take care of him, and not to him: so hardened was he in his iniquity, he had stretched out his hand against his brother, and now he stretched it out against God, and ran upon him, even on the thick bosses of his buckler. </p>

I know what thou hast done; thou hast slain thy brother, thine own, thine only brother, a holy, righteous, and good man, who never gave thee any offence, or any just occasion of shedding his innocent blood: this he said as knowing what he had done, and to impress his mind with a sense of the evil, and to bring him to a confession of it, before the sentence was passed, that it might appear to all to be just, and of which there was full proof and evidence, as follows: </p>
<p> the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground ; where it was split, and in which it was covered and hid, and where perhaps Cain had buried his body, that it might not be seen, and the murder not discovered; but God saw what was done, and the voice of innocent blood came into his ears, and cried for vengeance at his hands: it is in the original, &quot;the voice of thy brother's bloods&quot;F19&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;  &#1491;&#1502;&#1497;   &quot;vox Sanguinum&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, &c. , in the plural; which the Jews generally understood of the posterity that would have descended from Abel, had he not been murdered: the Targum of Onkelos is,&quot;the voice of the blood of the seeds or generations that should come from thy brother;'see 2 Kings 9:26   or it may respect the blood of the seed of the woman, of all the righteous ones that should be slain in like manner. The Jerusalem Targum is,&quot;the voice of the bloods of the multitude of the righteous that shall spring from Abel thy brother,'or succeed him; see Matthew 23:35 .

<p> and from, thy face shall I be hid ; not from his omniscience and omnipresence, for there is no such thing as being hid from the all seeing eye of God, or flying from his presence, which is everywhere; but from his favour and good will, and the outward tokens of it, as well as from the place where his Shechinah or divine Majesty was; and which was the place of public worship, and where good men met and worshipped God, and offered sacrifice to him: and from the place of divine worship and the ordinances of it, and the church of God and communion with it, an hypocrite does not choose to be debarred: </p>

Cain seems to be more afraid of a corporeal death than to have any concern about his soul, and the eternal welfare of it, or to be in dread and fear of an eternal death, or wrath to come; though some think the words should be rendered in a prayerF24Lightfoot, vol. 1. p. 3, , &quot;let it be that anyone that findeth me may kill me&quot;; being weary of life under the horrors of a guilty conscience. </p>

At first indeed Cain could marry no other than his sister; but whether he married Abel's twin sister, or his own twin sister, is disputed; the Jews sayF7Pirke Eliezer, c. 21. , that Cain's twin sister was not a beautiful woman, and therefore he said, I will kill my brother and take his wife: on the other hand, the Arabic writers sayF8Abulpharag. Hist. Dynast. p. 4. Patricides apud Selden, de Jure Nat. & Gent. l. 3. c. 2. & l. 5. c. 9. , that Adam would have had Cain married Abel's twin sister, whom they call Awin; and Abel have married Cain's twin sister, whom they call Azron; but Cain would not, because his own sister was the handsomest; and this they take to be the occasion of the quarrel, which issued in the murder of Abel. </p>

<p> and he builded a city : for a settlement on earth, thinking of nothing but this world, and the things of it; or to secure himself from being slain by men; or it may be for his amusement, to divert his thoughts from the melancholy scene always presented to his mind, by being thus employed; and his posterity growing numerous, he took this method to keep them together, and that they might be able to defend themselves from the assaults of others. Some render the words, &quot;he was building a city&quot;F9&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;  &#1489;&#1504;&#1492;   &quot;et fuit aedificans&quot;, Montanus, Drusius; &quot;era aedificans&quot;.

<p> and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch : not after his own name, which was odious and infamous, but after his son's name, to show his affection to him, and that his name might be continued in ages to come; see Psalm 49:11 . This was the first city that was built, that we read of. Sir Walter Raleigh conjecturesF11History of the World, par. 1. B. 1. c. 5. sect. 2. p. 43.  that the Henochii or Heniochi of Pliny, Ptolemy, and other writers, took their name from this city of Henoch, or from the country where it stood, when it was repeopled after the flood, since these people were due east from the garden of Eden. (For Cain to marry his sister or any other close relation was not harmful as it is today. There would be few if any genetic disorders at this time. However, as time past, the human race accumulated more and more genetic defects, so by the time of Moses, the laws against incest, as given in Leviticus 18:1 , were necessary.

The names of the immediate posterity of Genos or Cain, according to Sanchoniatho, and, as Philo BybliusF12Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 1. p. 34,35.  has translated them, were light, fire, and flame; who found out fire by rubbing pieces of wood together, and taught the use of it, from whence they seem to have their names. These begat sons that exceeded others in bulk and height, whose names were given to the mountains they first possessed, and from them were called Cassius, Libanus, Antilibanus, and Brathy; and of them were begotten Memrumus and Hypsuranius, so called by their mothers, women, who, without shame, lay with everyone they could meet with; of these came Agreus and Halieus, the inventors of fishing and hunting; and these seem to answer to the generations from Cain to Lamech; and it is no wonder Moses should take no more notice of such a set of men; which, according to their own historian, deserved but little regard. </p>

This evil practice, though it began in the race of wicked Cain, was in later ages followed by some among the people of God, which was connived at because of the hardness of their hearts; otherwise it was not so from the beginning. This was the first instance of it known; Jarchi says it was the way of the generation before the flood to have one wife for procreation of children, and the other for carnal pleasure; the latter drank a cup of sterility, that she might be barren, and was adorned as a bride, and lived deliciously; and the other was used roughly, and mourned like a widow; but by this instance it does not appear, for these both bore children to Lamech. </p>
<p> The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah ; whose daughters they were cannot be said, no doubt of the race of Cain; the name of the one signifies an &quot;ornament&quot;, or beauty, and might seem to answer to the account Jarchi gives of the wife for pleasure, if there were any foundation for it; and the other signifies a &quot;shadow&quot;, being continually under the shadow of her husband. </p>

<p> he was the father of all such that handle the harp and organ : he was the inventor of instrumental music, both of stringed instruments, such as were touched by the fingers, or struck with a quill, as the &quot;harp&quot;; and of wind instruments, such as were blown, as the &quot;organ&quot;, which seems not to be the same we call so, being a late invention; but however a pleasant instrument, as its name signifies. Jubal is thought by some to be the same with Apollo, to whom with the Greeks the invention of the harp is ascribed; and some have been of opinion, that the jubilee trumpet was so called from Jubal, Leviticus 25:9 . SanchoniathoF18Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 1. p. 35.  makes Chrysor or Vulcan, the same with Tubalcain, the brother of Jubal, to exercise himself in eloquence, songs and divination, confounding or mistaking the employment of the two brothers. The Arabs have such a notion of the Cainites being the inventors of music, that they commonly call a singing girl &quot;Cainah&quot;F19Abulpharag. Hist. Dynast. p. 9. ; and the Arabic writersF20Elmacinus, p. 8. apud Hottinger. Smegma, p. 232.  make Jubal to be the first inventor of music, and that the beasts and birds gathered together to hear him; the same that is said of Orpheus. </p>

<p>And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain ,.... Thought by many to be the same with Vulcan, his name and business agreeing; for the names are near in sound, Tubalcain may easily pass into Vulcan; and who, with the Heathens, was the god of the smiths, and the maker of Jupiter's thunderbolts, as this was an artificer in iron and brass, as follows: his name is compounded of two words, the latter of which was no doubt put into his name in memory of Cain his great ancestor; the former JosephusF21Antiqu. l. 1. c. 2. sect. 2.  reads Thobel, and says of him, that he exceeded all in strength, and had great skill in military affairs: </p>
<p> an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron ; he taught men the way of melting metals, and of making armour and weapons of war, and other instruments, for various uses, out of them; and he seems to be the same with the Chrysor of Sanchoniatho; for he saysF23Ut supra. (Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 1. p. 35.)  of them (Agreus and Halieus) were begotten two brothers, the inventors of iron, and of working of it: one of these, called Chrysor, is said to be Hephaestus or Vulcan; and Chrysor, as BochartusF24Canaan, l. 2. c. 2.  Colossians 706 .  seems rightly to conjecture, is &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; , &quot;Choresh-Ur, a worker in fire&quot;; that, by means of fire, melted metals, and cast them into different forms, and for different uses; and one of these words is used in the text of Tubalcain; and so, according to Diodorus SiculusF25Bibliothec. l. 1. p. 11,13. & l. 5. p. 341. , Vulcan signifies fire, and was not only the inventor of fire, but he says he was the inventor of all works in iron, brass, gold, and silver, and of all other things wrought by fire, and of all other uses of fire, both by artificers and all other men, and therefore he was called by all    &#960;&#965;&#961; , &quot;fire&quot;. Clemens of AlexandriaF26Stromat. l. 1. p. 307. Vid. Plin. Nat.

<p>And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah ,.... Confessing what he had done, or boasting what he would do should he be attacked; or in order to make his wives easy, who might fear from his fierceness and cruelty; and the murders he had committed, or on account of Abel's murder, Genesis 4:15   that either the judgments of God would fall upon him and them, or some man or other would dispatch him and his; wherefore calling them together, he thus bespeaks them: </p>
<p> hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech ; this he said in an imperious manner to them, demanding their attention and regard, and as glorying in, instead of being ashamed of his polygamy, and in a blustering way, as neither fearing God nor man; or rather speaking comfortably to them, to remove their fears: </p>
<p> for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt ; which, as some say, were his great-grandfather Cain, and his son Tubalcain: according to a tradition of the JewsF9R. Gedaliah, Shalshaleth Hakabala, fol. 74. 2. Jarchi in loc. , it was after this manner; Cain being old, and blind, and weary, sat in a thicket among the trees to rest himself; when Lamech, who was blind also, and led by Tubalcain hunting, who seeing Cain, and taking him for a wild beast, bid Lamech draw his bow, which he did, and killed him; but coming nearer, and finding it was Cain, was wroth and angry, and slew the young man: the Arabic writersF11Elmacinus, p. 7. apud Hottinger. Smegma Oriental. l. 1. c. 8. p. 224, 225.  tell the story with a little variation, and&quot;Lamech being in a wood with one of his sons, and hearing a noise in it, supposing it to be a wild beast, cast a stone, which fell upon Cain, and killed him ignorantly; and the lad that led him said, what hast thou done? thou hast killed Cain; at which being very sorrowful after the manner of penitents, he smote his hands together, and the lad standing before him, he struck his head with both his hands, and killed him unawares; and coming to his wives, Adah and Zillah, said to them, hear my word, he that slew Abel shall be avenged sevenfold, but Lamech seventy times seven, who killed a man with a cast of a stone, and a young man by clapping of his hands.'And our version, and others, imply, that he killed both a man, and a young man, or some one person or more, and that he was sorry for it, made confession of it; it was to the wounding and grief of his soul, which does not so well agree with one of the wicked race of Cain: wherefore the words may be rendered, &quot;though I have slain a man&quot;F12So the particle &#1499;&#1497;   is sometimes used; see Nold. Part. Ebr. Concord. p. 399. , that is nothing to you, you are not accountable for it, nor have any thing to fear coming upon you by reason of that; it is to my own wounding, damage, and hurt, if to any, and not to you. Some versions render it, &quot;I would slay a man&quot;, &c.F13&#1492;&#1512;&#1490;&#1514;&#1497;   &quot;interficerem&quot;, Vatablus; &quot;certe ausim interficere&quot;, Piscator; &quot;sane occiderem, ant occiderim&quot;, Muis, Rivet.  any man, young or old, that should attack me; I fear no man: if any man wounds me, or offers to do me any hurt, I would slay him at once; I doubt not but I should be more than a match for him, be he who he will that shall set upon me, and kill him; though I might receive some slight wound, or some little hurt in the engagement, and therefore you need not be afraid of any man's hurting me. The Arabic version reads interrogatively, &quot;have I killed a man &c.?&quot; and so some othersF14&quot;An virum inferfeci?&quot; De Dieu. , I have not; with which agree the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan,&quot;I have not killed a man;'for which he or his posterity should be punished, as they interpreted it; and therefore his wives had no need to fear any ill should befall him or them, or that the murder of Abel should be avenged on them, this being the seventh generation in which it was to be avenged, Genesis 4:15   wherefore it follows, </p>

<p>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

<p>And Adam knew his wife again ,.... The Targum of Jonathan adds, at the end of a hundred and thirty years after Abel was killed, see Genesis 5:3   but, according to Bishop Usher, Seth was born the same year, which is most probable. </p>
<p> And she bare a son, and called his name Seth , that is, &quot;put, placed, set&quot;; not with any respect to Cain, who had no settled fixed abode, but wandered about; or to Seth as a foundation of the church and true religion, being a type of Christ the only foundation, though he may be considered in such a light; but the reason of his name follows: </p>
<p> for God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew ; that is, another son in his room; and by calling him a &quot;seed&quot;, she may have respect unto the promised seed, whom she once thought Cain was, or however expected him in his line, as being the firstborn; but he proving a wicked man, and having slain his brother Abel, on whom her future hope was placed, has another son given her, and substituted in his room, in whom, and in whose family, the true religion would be preserved, and from whom the Messiah, the promised seed, would spring see Galatians 3:16 . </p>

<p>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son ,.... When he was an hundred and five years old, Genesis 5:6   and this is mentioned as a further proof and instance of God's goodness to Adam's family in this line, that there was a succession in it, where the true worship of God was kept, and from whence the Messiah was to arise, and as a pledge and confirmation of it: </p>
<p> and he called his name Enos ; which is generally interpreted a weak, feeble, frail, mortal, miserable man; which Seth being sensible of, and observing the sorrows of human life, and especially an increase of them among good men through the growing corruptions of the age, gave this name to his son; though it may be observed, that the derivation of this name may be from the Arabic word &quot;anas&quot;F15&quot;Consuevit, assuevit, et familiaris evasit&quot;, Golius, col. 169. , to be sociable and familiar; man being a sociable creature, not only in civil but in religious things, and so a reason of the name may be taken from what follows: </p>
<p> then began men to call upon the name of the Lord ; not but that Adam and Abel, and all good men, had called upon the name of the Lord, and prayed to him, or worshipped him before this time personally, and in their families; but now the families of good men being larger, and more numerous, they joined together in social and public worship: or since it may be thought there were public assemblies for religious worship before this time, though it may be they had been neglected, and now were revived with more zeal and vigour; seeing the Cainites incorporating themselves, and joining families together, and building cities, and carrying on their civil and religious affairs among themselves, they also formed themselves into distinct bodies; and not only separated from them, but called themselves by a different name; for so the words may be rendered: &quot;then began men to call themselves&quot;, or &quot;to be called by the name of the Lord&quot;F16&#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;  &#1489;&#1513;&#1501;  &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;   &quot;vocari de nomine Jehovae&quot;, Piscator. ; the sons of God, as distinct from the sons of men; which distinction may be observed in Genesis 6:2   and has been retained more or less ever since: some choose to translate the words, &quot;then began men to call in the name of the Lord&quot;F17&quot;Ad invocandum in nomine Domini&quot;, Montanus, &quot;vel vocare in nomine Domini&quot;, Cartwright. ; that is, to call upon God in the name of the Messiah, the Mediator between God and man; having now, since the birth of Seth, and especially of Enos, clearer notions of the promised seed, and of the use of him, and his name, in their addresses to God; see John 14:13 . The Jews give a very different sense of these words; the Targum of Onkelos is,&quot;then in his days the children of men ceased from praying in the name of the Lord;'and the Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;this was the age, in the days of which they began to err, and they made themselves idols, and surnamed their idols by the name of the Word of the Lord;'with which agrees the note of Jarchi,&quot;then they began to call the names of men, and the names of herbs, by the name of the blessed God, to make idols of them:'and some of them say, particularly MaimonidesF18Hilchot Obede Cochabim, c. 1. sect. 1. R, Gedaliah, Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 74. 2. Juchasin, fol. 134. 2. , that Enos himself erred, and fell into idolatry, and was the first inventor of images, by the mediation of which men prayed to God: but all this seems to be without foundation, and injurious to the character of this antediluvian patriarch; nor does it appear that idolatry obtained in the posterity of Seth, or among the people of God so early; nor is such an account agreeable to the history which Moses is giving of the family of Seth, in opposition to that of Cain; wherefore one or other of the former senses is best. </p>

<p> in the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him ; this is repeated from Genesis 1:27   to put in mind that man is a creature of God; that God made him, and not he himself; that the first man was not begotten or produced in like manner as his sons are, but was immediately created; that his creation was in time, when there were days, and it was not on the first of these, but on the sixth; and that he was made in the likeness of God, which chiefly lay in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, and in dominion over the creatures. </p>

<p>Male and female created he them ,.... Adam and Eve, the one a male, the other a female; and but one male and one female, to show that one man and one woman only were to be joined together in marriage, and live as man and wife for the procreation of posterity; and these were not made together, but first the male, and then the female out of him, though both in one day: </p>
<p> and blessed them ; with a power of propagating their species, and multiplying it, and with all other blessings of nature and providence; with an habitation in the garden of Eden; with leave to eat of the fruit of all the trees in it, but one; with subjection of all the creatures to them, and with communion with God in their enjoyments: </p>
<p> and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created ; which, as PhiloF19Leg. Allegor. l. 1. p. 57.  observes, signifies &quot;earth&quot;; and according to JosephusF20Antiqu. l. 1. c. 1. sect. 2.  red earth, out of which Adam was made; and as soon as he was made, this name was imposed upon him by God, to put him in mind of his original, that he was of the earth, earthly; and the same name was given to Eve, because made out of him, and because other marriage with him, and union to him; on that account, as ever since, man and wife bear the same name: wherefore I should rather think the name was given them from their junction and union together in love; so the name may be derived from the Arabic wordF21&quot;junxit, addiditque rem rei---amore junxit&quot;, Golius,  Colossians 48 .  signifying to &quot;join&quot;: though some think they had it from their beauty, and the elegance of their formF23&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;   &quot;pulcher fuit, nituit&quot;, Stockius, p. 13.

<p>And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years ,.... The Septuagint version, through mistaken, gives the number two hundred and thirty years: </p>
<p> and begat a son ; not that he had no other children during this time than Cain and Abel; this is only observed to show how old he was when Seth was born, the son here meant; who was begotten </p>
<p> in his own likeness, after his image ; not in the likeness, and after the image of God, in which Adam was created; for having sinned, he lost that image, at least it was greatly defaced, and he came short of that glory of God, and could not convey it to his posterity; who are, and ever have been conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity; are polluted and unclean, foolish and disobedient; averse to all that is good, and prone to all that is evil: the sinfulness of nature is conveyed by natural generation, but not holiness and grace; that is not of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the flesh, but of God, and produced of his own will, by his mighty power impressing the image of his Son in regeneration on his people; which by beholding his glory they are more and more changed into by the Spirit of God. The Jewish writers understand this in a good sense, of Seth being like to Adam in goodness, when Cain was not: so the Targum of Jonathan,&quot;and he begat Seth, who was like to his image and similitude; for before Eve had brought forth Cain, who was not like unto him---but afterwards she brought forth him who was like unto him, and called his name Seth.'So they sayF26Pirke Eliezer, c. 22.  Cain was not of the seed, nor of the image of Adam, nor his works like Abel his brother; but Seth was of the seed and image of Adam, and his works were like the works of his brother Abel; according to that, &quot;he begat (a son) in his own likeness&quot;. And they assertF1Shalshalet Hakabala, apud Hottinger. Smegma, p. 212. , that Adam delivered all his wisdom to Seth his son, who was born after his image and likeness; and particularly MaimonidesF2More Nevochim, par. 1. c. 7.  observes, that all the sons of Adam before Seth were rather beasts than men, and had not the true human form, not the form and image of men; but Seth, after Adam had taught and instructed him, was in human perfection, as it is said of him, &quot;and he begat in his likeness&quot;: but the text speaks not of the education of Seth, and of what he was through that, but of his birth, and what he was in consequence of it; and we are told by good authority, that &quot;that which is born of the flesh is flesh&quot;, carnal and corrupt, and such are all the sons of Adam by natural generation; see Job 14:4 . </p>

The Septuagint version is seven hundred; for having added one hundred years more the should be, to the years of his life before the birth of Seth, here they are taken away to make the number of his years complete: </p>
<p> and he begat sons and daughters ; not only after the birth of Seth, but before, though we have no account of any, unless of Cain's wife; but what their number was is not certain, either before or after; some say he had thirty children, besides Cain, Abel, and Seth; and others a hundredF3Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 74. 2. . Josephus says the number of children, according to the old tradition, was thirty three sons and twenty three daughters.F4Joseph. Antiqu. l. 1. c. 1. footnote on point 3. (These families had at least five children, for one son is named as well as other sons and daughters. Therefore there must be at least three sons and two daughters in each family. For a family to have at least three sons and two daughters, according to the laws of chance, a family must on the average have nine children for this to be a near certainty. Hence the families listed in this chapter must have been large by today's standards. Given their long life, this is not at all unusual. However even today, the Old Order Mennonites of Waterloo County in Ontario and Lancaster County in Pennsylvannia, have many families this large. Ed.) </p>

<p>And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years ,.... Not lunar years, as VarroF4Apud Lactant. Institut. l. 2. c. 13. , but solar years, which consisted of three hundred and sixty five days and odd hours, and such were in use among the Egyptians in the times of Moses; and of these must be the age of Adam, and of his posterity in this chapter, and of other patriarchs in this book; or otherwise, some must be said to beget children at an age unfit for it, particularly Enoch, who must beget a son in the sixth year of his age; and the lives of some of them must be very short, even shorter than ours, as Abraham and others; and the time between the creation and the deluge could not be two hundred years: but this long life of the antediluvians, according to the Scripture account, is confirmed by the testimony of many Heathen writers, who affirm that the ancients lived a thousand years, as many of them did, pretty near, though not quite, they using a round number to express their longevity by; for the proof of this JosephusF5Antiqu. l. 1. c. 3. sect. 9.  appeals to the testimonies of Manetho the Egyptian, and Berosus the Chaldean, and Mochus and Hestiaeus; besides Jerom the Egyptian, and the Phoenician writers; also Hesiod, Hecataeus, Hellanicus, Acusilaus, Ephorus and Nicolaus. And though the length of time they lived may in some measure be accounted for by natural things as means, such as their healthful constitution, simple diet, the goodness of the fruits of the earth, the temperate air and climate they lived in, their sobriety, temperance, labour and exercise; yet no doubt it was so ordered in Providence for the multiplication of mankind, for the cultivation of arts and sciences, and for the spread of true religion in the world, and the easier handing down to posterity such things as were useful, both for the good of the souls and bodies of men. MaimonidesF6More Nevochim, par. 2. p. 47.  is of opinion, that only those individual persons mentioned in Scripture lived so long, not men in common; and which was owing to their diet and temperance, and exact manner of living, or to a miracle; but there is no reason to believe that they were the only temperate persons, or that any miracle should be wrought particularly on their account for prolonging their lives, and not others. But though they lived so long, it is said of them all, as here of the first man: </p>
<p> and he died , according to the sentence of the law in Genesis 2:17   and though he died not immediately upon his transgression of the law, yet he was from thence forward under the sentence of death, and liable to it; yea, death seized upon him, and was working in him, till it brought him to the dust of it; his life, though so long protracted, was a dying life, and at last he submitted to the stroke of death, as all his posterity ever since have, one or two excepted, and all must; for &quot;it is appointed unto men once to die&quot;. Hebrews 9:27 . The ArabicF7Patricides, p. 5. Elmacinus, p. 6. apud Hottinger. Smegma Oriental. l. 1. c. 8. p. 216, 217.  writers relate, that Adam when he was near death called to him Seth, Enos, Kainan, and Mahalaleel, and ordered them by his will, when he was dead, to embalm his body with myrrh, frankincense, and cassia, and lay it in the hidden cave, the cave of Machpelah, where the JewsF8Pirke Eliezer, c. 20. Juchasin, fol. 5. 1.  say he was buried, and where Abraham, Sarah, &c. were buried; and that if they should remove from the neighbourhood of paradise, and from the mountain where they dwelt, they should take his body with them, and bury it in the middle or the earth. They are very particular as to the time of his death. They sayF9Patricides & Elamacinus, apud Hottinger. ib.  it was on a Friday, the fourteenth of Nisan, which answers to part of March and part of April, A. M. nine hundred and thirty, in the ninth hour of that day. The Jews are divided about the funeral of him; some say Seth buried him; others, Enoch; and others, God himselfF11Juchasin, ut supra.

Seth, according to JosephusF12Antiqu. l. 1. c. 2. sect. 3. , was a very good man, and brought up his children well, who trod in his steps, and who studied the nature of the heavenly bodies; and that the knowledge of these things they had acquired might not be lost, remembering a prophecy of Adam, that the world should be destroyed both by fire and by water, they erected two pillars, called Seth's pillars; the one was made of brick, and the other of stone, on which they inscribed their observations, that so if that of brick was destroyed by a flood, that of stone might remain; and which the above writer says continued in his time in the land of Siriad. The Arabic writersF13Elmacinus, Patricides, apud Hottinger, p. 228,229.  make Seth to be the inventor of the Hebrew letters, and say, that when he was about to die he called to him Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, their wives and children, and adjured them by the blood of Abel not to descend from the mountain where they dwelt, after the death of Adam, nor suffer any of their children to go to, or mix with any of the seed of Cain, which were in the valley; whom he blessed, and ordered by his will to serve the Lord, and then died in the year of his age nine hundred and twelve, on the third day of the week of the month Ab (which answers to part of July and part of August), A.

<p> saying, this same shall comfort us, concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground, which the Lord hath cursed ; this he spake by a spirit of prophecy, foreseeing what his son would be, and of what advantage to him and his family, and to the world, both in things temporal and spiritual. In things temporal: the earth was cursed for the sin of man immediately after the fall, and continued under it to this time, bringing forth thorns and thistles in great abundance of itself, which occasioned much trouble to root and pluck them up, and nothing else, without digging, and planting, and sowing; and being barren through the curse, it was with great difficulty men got a livelihood: now Noah eased them in a good measure of their toil and trouble, by inventing instruments of ploughing, as Jarchi suggests, which they had not before, but threw up the ground with their hands, and by the use of spades, or such like things, which was very laborious; but now, by the use of the plough, and beasts to draw it, their lives were made much more easy and comfortable; hence he is said to begin to be an &quot;husbandman&quot;, or a &quot;man of the earth&quot;, that brought agriculture to a greater perfection, having found out an easier and quicker manner of tilling the earth: and as he was the first that is said to plant a vineyard, if he was the inventor of wine, this was another way in which he was an instrument of giving refreshment and comfort to men, that being what cheers the heart of God and men, see Genesis 9:20   and if the antediluvians were restrained from eating of flesh, and their diet was confined to the fruits of the earth; Noah, as Dr. LightfootF4Works, vol. 1. p. 9.  observes, would be a comfort in reference to this, because to him, and in him to all the world, God would give liberty to eat flesh; so that they were not obliged to get their whole livelihood with their hands out of the ground: and moreover, as Lamech might be apprised of the flood by the name of his father, and the prediction of his grandfather, he might foresee that he and his family would be saved, and be the restorer of the world, and repeople it, after the destruction of it by the flood. And he may have respect to comfort in spiritual things, either at first taking him to be the promised seed, the Messiah, in whom all comfort is; or however a type of him, and from whom he should spring, who would deliver them from the curse of the law, and from the bondage of it, and from toiling and seeking for a righteousness by the works of it; or he might foresee that he would be a good man, and a preacher of righteousness, and be a public good in his day and generation. </p>

According to the Arabic writersF12Elmacinus, Patricides apud Hottinger. Smegma, l. 1. c. viii. p. 226, 227, 228. , immediately after the death of Adam the family of Seth was separated from the family of Cain; Seth took his sons and their wives to a high mountain (Hermon), on the top of which Adam was buried, and Cain and all his sons lived in the valley beneath, where Abel was slain; and they on the mountain obtained a name for holiness and purity, and were so near the angels that they could hear their voices and join their hymns with them; and they, their wives and their children, went by the common name of the sons of God: and now these were adjured, by Seth and by succeeding patriarchs, by no means to go down from the mountain and join the Cainites; but notwithstanding in the times of Jared some did go down, it seems; See Gill on Genesis 5:20   and after that others, and at this time it became general; and being taken with the beauty of the daughters of Cain and his posterity, they did as follows: </p>
<p> and they took them wives of all that they chose ; not by force, as Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom interpret, for the Cainites being more numerous and powerful than they, it can hardly be thought that the one would attempt it, or the other suffer it; but they intermarried with them, which the Cainites might not be averse unto; they took to them wives as they fancied, which were pleasing to the flesh, without regard to their moral and civil character, and without the advice and consent of their parents, and without consulting God and his will in the matter; or they took women as they pleased, and were to their liking, and committed fornication, to which the Cainites were addicted; for they spent their time in singing and dancing, and in uncleanness, whereby the posterity of Seth or sons of God were allured to come down and join them, and commit fornication with them, as the Arabic writersF13Elmacinus, Patricides apud Hottinger.

<p>And the Lord said ,.... Not to Noah, as in Genesis 6:13   for, as yet, he is not taken notice of, or any discourse addressed to him; but rather to or within himself, he said what follows, or thus concluded, and resolved on in his own mind: </p>
<p> my Spirit shall not always strive with man ; meaning either the soul of man, called the Spirit of God, Job 27:3   because of his creation, and is what he breathes and puts into men, and therefore is styled the Father of spirits; and which is in man, as some in Aben Ezra observe to be the sense the word used, as a sword in the scabbard; and so the meaning is, it shall not always abide there, but be unsheathed and drawn out; man shall not live always, since he is corrupt, and given to carnal lusts: or else, as Jarchi thinks, God himself is meant, and that the sense is, my Spirit shall not always contend within myself; or there shall not always be contention within me concerning man, whether I shall destroy him, or have mercy on him; I am at a point to punish him, since he is wholly carnal: or rather this is to be understood of the Holy Spirit of God, as the Targum of Jonathan, which agrees with 1 Peter 3:18   and to be thus interpreted; that the Spirit of God, which had been litigating and reasoning the point, as men do in a court of judicature, as the word signifies, with these men in the court, and at the bar of their own consciences, by one providence or by one minister or another, particularly by Noah, a preacher of righteousness, in vain, and to no purpose; therefore, he determines to proceed no longer in this way, but pass and execute the sentence of condemnation on them: </p>
<p> for that he also is flesh ; not only carnal and corrupt, but sadly corrupted, and wholly given up to and immersed in sensual lusts and carnal pleasures, so as not to be restrained nor reformed; even the posterity of Seth, professors of religion also, as well as the profane world and posterity of Cain: </p>
<p> yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years : meaning not the term of man's life, reduced to this from the length of time he lived before the flood; but this designs the space that God would give for repentance, before he proceeded to execute his vengeance on him; this is that &quot;longsuffering of God&quot; the apostle speaks of in the afore mentioned place, &quot;that waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing&quot;; and so both the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan interpret it of a space of an hundred and twenty years given them to repent: now whereas it was but an hundred years from the birth of Japheth to the flood, some think the space was shortened twenty years, because of their impenitence; but it is more probable what Jarchi observes, that this decree was made and given out twenty years before his birth, though here related, by a figure called &quot;hysteron proteron&quot;, frequent in the Scriptures. </p>

<p>There were giants in the earth in those days ,.... That is, in the days before the sons of God took the daughters of men for wives, in such a general manner as before declared, or before the declension and apostasy became so universal; even in the times of Jared, as the Arabic writersF14Elmacinus & Patricides apud Hottinger, p. 235, 236.  understand it, who say that these giants were begotten on the daughters of Cain by the children of Seth, who went down from the mountain to them in the days of Jared, see Genesis 5:20   the word &quot;Nephilim&quot; comes from a word which signifies to fall; and these might be so called, either because they made their fear to fall upon men, or men, through fear, to fall before them, because of their height and strength; or rather because they fell and rushed on men with great violence, and oppressed them in a cruel and tyrannical manner; or, as some think, because they fell off and were apostates from the true religion, which is much better than to understand them of apostate angels, whom the Targum of Jonathan mentions by name, and calls them Schanchazai and Uziel, who fell from heaven, and were in the earth in those days: </p>
<p> and also after that , which shows that the preceding clause respects giants in former times: </p>
<p> when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men , came into their houses and chambers, and lay with them: </p>
<p> and they bare children unto them , or giants unto them, as may be supplied from the former clause; for the sense is, as there were giants before this general defection, so there were at this time, when there was a mixture of the Cainites and Sethites; which were the offspring of the sons of God, or posterity of Seth, mixing with the daughters of men, or the posterity of Cain; for this is not to be understood after the flood, as Aben Ezra, Ben Melech; and so they are described in the following words: </p>
<p> the same became mighty men ; for tallness and strength, for power and dominion, for tyranny and oppression: </p>
<p> which were of old : like those that were of old before; or who in after times were spoken of, as in the days of old: </p>

<p>And God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth ,.... That it spread throughout the earth, wherever it was inhabited by men, both among the posterity of Cain and Seth, and who indeed now were mixed together, and become one people: this respects actual transgressions, the wicked actions of men, and those of the grosser sort, which were &quot;multiplied&quot;F18&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;   &quot;augescere&quot;, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator; &quot;multiplicaretur&quot;, Schmidt.  as the word also signifies; they were both great in quality and great in quantity; they were frequently committed, and that everywhere; the degeneracy was become universal; there was a flood of impiety that spread and covered the whole earth, before the deluge of waters came, and which was the cause of it: this God saw, not only by his omniscience, by which he sees everything, but he took notice of it in his providence, and was displeased with it, and determined in his mind to show his resentment of it, and let men see that he observed it, and disapproved of it, and would punish for it: </p>
<p> and that, every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually : the heart of man is evil and wicked, desperately wicked, yea, wickedness itself, a fountain of iniquity, out of which abundance of evil flows, by which it may be known in some measure what is in it, and how wicked it is; but God, that sees it, only knows perfectly all the wickedness of it, and the evil that is in it: the &quot;thoughts&quot; of his heart are evil; evil thoughts are formed in the heart, and proceed from it; they are vain, foolish, and sinful, and abominable in the sight of God, by whom they are seen, known, and understood afar off: the &quot;imagination&quot; of his thoughts is evil, the formation of them; they were evil while forming, the substratum of thought, the very beginning of it, the first motion to it, yea, &quot;every&quot; such one was evil, and &quot;only&quot; so; not one good among them, not one good thing in their hearts, no one good thought there, nor one good imagination of the thought; and so it was &quot;continually&quot; from their birth, from their youth upwards, throughout the whole of their lives, and all the days of their lives, night and day, and day after day, without intermission: this respects the original corruption of human nature, and shows it to be universal; for this was not only true of the men of the old world, but of all mankind; the same is said of men after the flood as before, and of all men in general without any exception, Genesis 8:21 . Hence appears the necessity of regeneration, and proves that the new creature is not an improvement of the old principles of corrupt nature, since there is no good thing in man but what is put into him; also the disability of man to do that which is good, even to think a good thought, or do a good action; therefore the works of unregenerate men are not properly good works, since they cannot flow from a right principle, or be directed to a right end. </p>

<p>And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth ,.... Because of the wickedness of man, the wickedness of his heart, and the wickedness of his life and conversation, which was so general, and increased to such a degree, that it was intolerable; wherefore God could have wished, as it were, that he had never made him, since he proved so bad; not that repentance, properly speaking, can fall upon God, for he never changes his mind or alters his purposes, though he sometimes changes the course and dispensations of his providence. This is speaking by an anthropopathy, after the manner of men, because God determined to do, and did something similar to men, when they repent of anything: as a potter, when he has formed a vessel that does not please him, and he repents that he has made it, he takes it and breaks it in pieces; and so God, because of man's wickedness, and to show his aversion to it, and displicency at it, repented of his making him; that is, he resolved within himself to destroy him, as in the next verse, which explains this: </p>
<p> and it grieved him at his heart ; this is to be understood by the same figure as before, for there can, no more be any uneasiness in his mind than a change in it; for God is a simple Being, uncompounded, and not subject to any passions and affections.

Some think the repentance, attributed to God in this and the preceding verse, is not to be understood of him in himself, but of his Spirit in good men, particularly Noah, producing grief, sorrow, and repentance in him, who wished that man had never been, than to be so wicked as he was; but for such a sense there seems to be no manner of foundation in the text. </p>

This grace, which Noah found and shared in, was the favour and good will of God; Noah was grateful and acceptable to him; he was well pleased with him in Christ; his person, services, and sacrifices, were acceptable to him through the Beloved; though he might not be acceptable in the eyes of men, who derided him for his piety and devotion, and especially for his prediction of the flood, and making an ark to save him and his family from it; yet he was very acceptable in the eyes of the Lord, and grateful in his sight, and was favoured with grace from him, who is the God of all grace, and with all the supplies of it: the Jerusalem Targum is, he&quot;found grace and mercy;'the grace he found was not on account of his own merit, but on account of the mercy of God: and this shows that he was not without sin, or he would have stood in no need of the mercy and grace of God to save him; and as he found grace and favour in things spiritual, so in things temporal; he found favour with God, and therefore he and his family were spared, when the whole world of the ungodly were destroyed; he found favour with God, and therefore was directed by him to build an ark, for the saving of himself and his; he found favour with him, and therefore he had the honour of being the preserver of mankind, and the father of a new world. </p>

<p>These are the generations of Noah ,.... Or this is the account of his posterity, of the persons that were generated by him, that sprung from him, and peopled the earth after the flood, who are mentioned in the next verse, what follows being to be put in a parenthesis; as the genealogy of Adam is carried on from Adam to Noah, Genesis 5:1   so the old world ending at the flood, the genealogy of the new world begins with Noah: though Aben Ezra and Ben Gersome interpret the word &quot;events&quot;, things which days bring forth, Proverbs 27:1   these are the events or the things which befell Noah, of which an account is given in this and some following chapters, whose character is next observed: </p>
<p> Noah was a just man ; not only before men, but in the sight of God; and not by his own works of righteousness, for no man is just by them before God, but by the righteousness of the promised seed, the Messiah; for he &quot;became heir of the righteousness which is by faith&quot;, Hebrews 11:7   the righteousness which was to be brought in by the Son of God, and which was revealed to him from faith to faith; and which by faith he received and lived upon, as every just man does, and believed in as his justifying righteousness before God; though he also lived a holy and righteous conversation before men, which may rather be intended in the next part of his character: </p>
<p> and perfect in his generations ; not that he was perfectly holy, or free from sin, but was a partaker of the true grace of God; was sincere and upright in heart and life; lived an unblemished life and conversation, untainted with the gross corruptions of that age he lived in, which he escaped through the knowledge, grace, and fear of God; and therefore it is added, that he was holy, upright, and blameless &quot;in his generations&quot;: among the men of the several generations he lived in, as in the generation before the flood, which was very corrupt indeed, and which corruption was the cause of that; and in the generation after the flood: or &quot;in his ages&quot;F23&#1489;&#1491;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;   &quot;in aetatibus suis&quot;, Drusius, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius. , in the several stages of his life, in youth and in old age; he was throughout the whole course of his life a holy good man. </p>

So LucianF3De Dea Syria. , and other Heathen writers, call it    &#955;&#945;&#961;&#957;&#945;&#958; , &quot;an ark&quot; or &quot;chest&quot;: this was made of &quot;Gopher wood&quot;, which all the Targums, and the more ancient Rabbins, understand of cedar wood; some the box tree, as the Arabic version; others, the pine; others, fir; the Mahometans say it was the Indian plane tree; and others, the turpentine tree: but the cypress tree bids fairest to be the wood of which, the ark was made, as FullerF4Miscellan. Sacr. l. 4. c. 5. , BochartF5Phaleg. l. 1. c. 4. col. 22, 23. , and othersF6Vid. Scheuchzer. Physic. Sacr. vol. 1. p. 35.  have shown; that being nearest to &quot;Gopher&quot; in sound, and being a wood very durable and incorruptible, and fit for shipping. Alexander made a navy of cypress trees in the groves and gardens about Babylon, as StraboF7Geograph, l. 16. p. 510.  relates: where this ark was made, is not easy to say: some think in Palestine; others, near Mount Caucasus, on the borders of India; others, in China: but it is most likely it was near the garden of Eden, where Noah lived, and not far from Ararat, where the ark rested. BochartF8Ut supra. (Phaleg. l. 1. c. 4. col. 22, 23.)  conjectures, that &quot;Gopher&quot; is the name of the place where it was made, as well as of the wood of which it was made; and that it might be Cupressetum or Cyparisson, which StraboF9Ib. p. 508.  places in Assyria. How long Noah was building the ark is variously conjectured: a JewishF11Pirke Eliezer, c. 23.  writer says fifty two years; and an Arabic writerF12Elmacinus, p. 11. apud Hottinger, Smegma, l. 1. c. 8. p. 249.  an hundred years; others think Noah was building it the whole one hundred and twenty yearsF13Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 1, 2. , the time of God's longsuffering and forbearance, which some conclude from 1 Peter 3:20   but though it would require not a few years to build such a vessel, and prepare everything necessary for the use of it, yet one would think it should not take so many years as the least account gives unto it: it may be observed, the order is, &quot;make thou&quot;, or &quot;for thyself&quot;F14&#1500;&#1498;   &quot;tibi&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, &c. ; for thy use and benefit, for the saving of thyself and family, as well as for the preservation of the several creatures which were for the service of him and his posterity: </p>

The Targum of Jonathan gives us the number of them, paraphrasing the words thus,&quot;one hundred and fifty cells shalt thou make for the ark on the left hand, and ten apartments in the middle to put food in, and five cabins on the right, and five on the left:&quot; </p>
<p> and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch ; it was pitched without to keep out the waters, and that they might more easily slide off, and to preserve the ark from being eat with worms, or hurt with the wind and sun; and it was pitched within, to take off the ill smell that might arise from the several creatures, as well as for the better security of the ark. Some take it to be bitumen, a sort of clay or slime like pitch, such as was used at the building of Babel, and of the walls of Babylon. De Dieu conjectures it was that kind of bitumen which the Arabs calls Kaphura, which agrees in sound with the word here used; but why not the pitch of the pine tree, or the rosin of the cypress tree, and especially the latter, if the ark was made of the wood of itF16Vid.

<p>And this is the fashion which thou shall make it of ,.... The form and size of it, its length, breadth, and height, as follows: </p>
<p> the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits ; which some interpret of geometrical cubits, each of which contained six ordinary cubits; others of sacred cubits, which were larger by an hand's breadth than the common cubit; but the general opinion of learned men now is, that they were common cubits of eighteen inches long; and by the geometrical calculations made by them it is found, that the ark of such dimensions was abundantly sufficient to contain Noah, and his family, and the various creatures, and all necessary provisions for themF17Vid. Buteonem de Area Noe, Hostum in fabricam Areae Noc, & Poli Synopsin. Scheuchzer, ut supra, (Physic. Sacr. vol. 1.) pp. 37,38. . But if the Jewish and Egyptian cubit, the cubit of the Scriptures, as Dr. CumberlandF18Of Scripture Weights and Measures, ch. 2. p. 56,57.  has shown it to be, consisted of twenty one inches and upwards, the ark according to them must be very near twice as great, and so more convenient for all the ends to which it was designed; for, as he observes, the cube of such a cubit is very near double to the cube of eighteen inches, and therefore so must the capacity be. (Noah's Ark was the largest sea-going vessel ever built, until, the late nineteenth century when giant metal ships were first constructed. The Ark was approximately 450 feet by seventy five feet; but as late as 1858&quot;the largest vessel of her type in the world was the P&O liner, &quot;Himalaya&quot;, 240 feet by thirty five feet...'In that year, Isambard K. Brunel produced the &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, 692 feet by 83 feet by 30 feet of approximately 19000 tons... five times the tonnage of any ship then afloat.

<p>A window shalt thou make to the ark ,.... Or a &quot;light&quot;, such as is that at noon, for which the word in the dual number is used; and therefore Junius and Tremellius translate it a &quot;clear light&quot;. The Jewish writersF19Targum Jonathan in loc. Pirke Eliezer, c. 23.  will have it to be a precious stone, a pearl which Noah fetched from the river Pison, and hung up in the ark, and it gave light to all the creatures, like a large chandelier; but a window no doubt it was to let light into the several apartments, and to look out at on occasion, since Noah is afterwards said to open it; but what it was made of is difficult to say, since it does not appear that as yet glass was invented. Some think it was made of crystal, which would let in light, and keep off the water. A very learnedF20Dickinson. Physic. vet & vera, c. 20. p. 324, 325.  man is of opinion, that Noah understanding chemistry, prepared a fine subtle fragrant spirit, of an oily nature and luminous, which he put into vessels made of crystal or glass, and hung them up in every room in the ark, and which was both illuminating and refreshing; and this he thinks is what is meant by the &quot;Zohar&quot;, or &quot;light&quot;, which we translate a &quot;window&quot;; but this is afterward said to be opened by Noah, to send forth the raven and the dove, which will not agree with such a vessel of spirituous liquor: </p>
<p> and in a cubit shall thou finish it above ; not the window, as some think, which they place at top of the ark, and suppose to be a cubit in length, but the ark itself, which was finished with a roof raised up a cubit high in the middle: </p>
<p> and the door of the ark shall thou set in the side thereof ; on which it is not said; an Arabic writerF21Patricides, apud Hottinger. p. 248, 250.  places it on the east side of it, on which side he supposes Noah and his sons dwelt, and on the west side his wife and his sons' wives. How large this door was is not said; it is reasonably supposedF23Scbeuchzer. Physica Sacra, vol. 1. p. 40.  to be ten cubits high and eight broad, that there might be room enough for an elephant to enter in by it; and it seems it was so large, that Noah, and those with him, could not shut it, but it was done by the Lord, Genesis 7:16 . </p>
<p> with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it : the above Arabic writerF24Patricides, apud Hottinger. p. 248, 250.  makes the lower story to be for the beasts, the second for the birds, and the third for Noah and his children; and with him agrees a Jewish writerF25Pirke Eliezer, c. 23. : but as by this distribution no place is left for provisions, they seem most correct who place the beasts in the lower story, and the birds with Noah and his family in the uppermost, and the provisions for all in the middle. This ark was a type of the church of God. As to the form and pattern of it, it was of God, so the separation of men from the world in a church state is of God; it is by his appointment, and it is his will, that when any numbers of men are converted in a place, that they should be incorporated together in a church state, the form of which is given by him, its officers appointed, and the laws and ordinances of it fixed by him: and as to the matter of it, &quot;Gopher wood&quot;, a lasting and incorruptible wood, denoting the duration of the church; God ever had, and ever will have a church in the world: as to the parts of it, and rooms in it, the rooms may point at particular churches, of which there have been many; or may signify, that there is always room enough in the church of God to receive saints. The ark had three stories in it, as the tabernacle and temple had three divisions, which were types of the same also; and may have respect to the visible church, consisting of believers and unbelievers, the invisible church, or general assembly of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven, and the church triumphant. The door into the ark may signify Christ, who, and faith in him, may be said to be the door into the church, and to all the ordinances of it: the window may either typify the glorious light of the Gospel, held forth in the church, or the ordinances of it, to which sensible souls betake themselves, as doves to their windows, Isaiah 60:8 . Into this ark not only Noah and his family, but creatures of all sorts were admitted, as sinners of all sorts called by grace, and become peaceable, are received into the church of God; yea, even good and bad have a place here, though the latter under the notion and character of the former, but are hypocrites in Zion: here also were plenty of provisions for all in it, as there are in the church of God fulness of spiritual provisions for all the people of God. The ark was of the use of a ship, and was the means of saving a few men, even Noah and his family; so the church of God has the nature and use of a ship, of which Christ is the pilot, and conducts it through the sea of this world, in which it is often tossed with tempests, and distressed; but at last brought to its haven, in which a few are saved, not as the cause, which alone is Christ, but as the means. The Apostle Peter makes baptism its antitype, 1 Peter 3:21   which is God's ordinance, and not man's, of his appointing; as to the form and manner of it, is the object of the world's scorn, when rightly administered, as Noah's ark was; represents a burial, as that did when Noah entered into it; and was an emblem of Christ's resurrection and ours, when he came out of it: it was a type of baptism in its salutary effect, it saves by water, as that does by leading to the resurrection of Christ; it saves not as a cause, but as a means of directing to Christ, the author of salvation; and saves not all in the water, only those that are in the ark, that is, truly and rightly in the church, and real members of it, or that are in Christ; and so many make the ark also a type of Christ. </p>

<p>And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth ,.... That there was such a flood of waters brought upon the earth, is confirmed by the testimonies of Heathen writers of all nations; only instead of Noah they put some person of great antiquity in their nation, as the Chaldeans, Sisithrus or Xisuthrus; the Grecians and Romans, Prometheus or Deucalion, or Ogyges. JosephusF26Antiqu. l. 1. c. 3. sect. 6.  says, all the writers of the Barbarian or Heathen history make mention of the flood and of the ark; and he produces the authorities of Berosus the Chaldean, and Hieronymus the Egyptian, who wrote the Phoenician antiquities, and Mnaseas, and many others, and Nicolaus of Damascus: and there are others that EusebiusF1Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 12, 19.  makes mention of, as Melo, who wrote against the Jews, yet speaks of the deluge, at which a man with his sons escaped; and Abydenus the Assyrian, whose account agrees with this of Moses that follows in many things; as do also what LucianF2De Dea Syria.  and OvidF3Metamorph. l. 1. Fab. 7.  have wrote concerning it, excepting in the name of the person in whose time it was: and not only the Egyptians had knowledge of the universal deluge, as appears from the testimony of Plato, who saysF4In Timaeo, & de Iside & Osir. , that an Egyptian priest related to Solon, out of their sacred books, the history of it; and from various circumstances in the story of Osiris and Typhon, which name they give to the sea, and in the Chaldee language signifies a deluge; and here the Targum of Onkelos renders the word by &quot;Tuphana&quot;; and the Arabs to this day call the flood &quot;Al-tufan&quot;; but the Chinese also frequently speak of the delugeF5Sinic. Hist. l. 1. p. 3, 26. ; and even it is said the Americans of Mexico and Peru had a tradition of itF6See Bishop Patrick, in loc. ; and the Bramines alsoF7Miscellanea Curiosa, vol. 8. p. 261, 262. , who say that 21,000 years ago the sea overwhelmed and drowned the whole earth, excepting one great hill, far to the northward, called &quot;Biudd&quot;; and that there fled thither one woman and seven men (whose names they give, see Genesis 7:13 ) those understanding out of their books that such a flood would come, and was then actually coming, prepared against the same, and repaired thither; to which place also went two of all sorts of creatures (see Genesis 6:19 ) herbs, trees, and grass, and of everything that had life, to the number in all of 1,800,000 living souls: this flood, they say, lasted one hundred and twenty years (see Genesis 6:3 ) five months and five days; after which time all these creatures that were thus preserved descended down again, and replenished the earth; but as for the seven men and woman, only one of them came down with her, and dwelt at the foot of the mountain.And this flood was not topical or national only, but general and universal: it was brought &quot;upon the earth&quot;, upon the whole earth, as the following account shows; and by the Lord himself, it was not through second causes, or the common course of things: and to show it possible and certain, this form of expression is used, &quot;behold, I, even I, do bring&quot;; it was wonderful, beyond the power of nature, and therefore a &quot;behold&quot; is prefixed; it was possible, because the Almighty God declares he would bring it; and it was certain, which the redoubling of the word points at; and would be quickly, since he said, &quot;I am bringing&quot;, or &quot;do bring&quot;; just about to do it; wherefore the ark was not so long preparing as some have thought, and the command to build it was not long before the flood came. The word for the flood comes from one which signifies to fallF8&#1504;&#1489;&#1500;   &quot;cecidit&quot;. , either because of the fall of the waters at it, or because it made all things to fall, wither, and decay, as herbs, plants, men, beasts, and all creatures; or from one that signifies to consume, or to mix and confound, and bring all things to confusion, as Jarchi suggestsF9&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;   &quot;consumpsit, vel&quot; &#1489;&#1500;&#1500;   &quot;confudit, miscuit&quot;. : and the end and intention of it, as here expressed, was </p>
<p> to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven ; every living creature, men and women, the beasts and cattle of the earth, and every creeping thing on it, and the fowls of the heaven, man principally, and these for his sake. </p>

<p>But with thee will I establish my covenant ,.... Made with Noah at this time, though not expressed, that on his making an ark, as God directed him, and going into it at his command, he would preserve him while building it from the rage of wicked men, and save him in it and his family, when the flood should come; and that they should come safe out of it, and repeople the world, which should be no more destroyed by one; for this covenant respects that later mentioned, Genesis 9:11   so Aben Ezra; or the promise of the Messiah, which should spring from him, for the fulfilment of which Noah and his family were spared; and this in every article God would confirm, of which he might be assured from his power, veracity, and faithfulness, and other perfections of his: </p>
<p> and thou shalt come into the ark ; when the covenant would begin more clearly to be established, and more plainly to be fulfilling; Noah on the one hand being obedient to the divine will, having built an ark, and entering into it; and on the other, God giving him leave, and an order to enter into it, and shutting him up in it to preserve him: </p>
<p> thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee ; that is, Noah and his wife, and his sons and their wives, in all eight persons; and eight only, as the Apostle Peter observes, 1 Peter 3:20   by this it appears that Noah's three sons were married before the flood, but as yet had no children. Jarchi concludes, from the mode of expression used, that the men and women were to be separate; that they entered the ark in this manner, and continued so, the use of the marriage bed being forbidden them while in the ark. </p>

<p>Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind ,.... What before is generally expressed by &quot;every living thing&quot;, is here particularly explained of every sort of them; and from the order of them some have thought that in the same manner they were disposed of in the ark, the fowls in the first story, the cattle in the next, and the creeping things in the lowermost: but others place them in a different manner; see Gill on Genesis 6:16   the roots and grain in the lower story, the living creatures of all sorts in the second, and their hay and litter in the third: the second story being three hundred cubits long, and fifty broad, contained in the whole fifteen thousand cubits, which is supposed to be divided into an hundred and fifty equal rooms; so the Targum of Jonathan on Genesis 6:14   of these, four are allowed for Noah and his family, two with earth for those animals that live underground, one for those which live on herbs and roots, and the other for those which live on flesh; and the other one hundred and forty four rooms are divided into three parts, that is, twenty four for birds, twenty five for beasts, and the other ninety five for such animals as are designed to be food for the rest; and according to the calculations of learned men, there appear to have been in this story rooms sufficient for all sorts of birds, beasts, and creeping thingsF11Vid. Bedford's Scripture Chronology, c. 12. p. 155. : </p>
<p> two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive ; that is, they shall come of themselves, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra observe, the providence of God so directing and impelling them, just as the creatures came to Adam; so that there was no need for Noah to take any pains by hunting or hawking to get such a number together: the Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;they shall come unto thee by the hand of an angel, who shall take and cause them to come.'So says another JewishF12Pirke Eliezer, c. 23.  writer, that they were collected by the angels who presided over each species; in which, except the notion of angels presiding over every kind of creature, there is no incongruity, as Bishop Patrick observes; and two of every sort were to come to the ark, to be preserved alive there, that they might propagate their species.

<p> Come thou and all thy house into the ark ; that is, he and his wife, his three sons and their wives: </p>
<p> for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation : this was a great character of Noah; that he was a &quot;righteous&quot; person, not by his own righteousness, but by the righteousness of faith he was both heir and preacher of; and this he was &quot;before&quot; God, in his sight, seen, known, and acknowledged by him as righteous; and therefore must be really so: and this shows that he was not so by the works of the law, but by the righteousness of Christ; because by them no flesh living is justified in the sight of God: and Noah was a rare instance of this character; there was none besides him in that wicked generation, so that he was very conspicuous and remarkable; and it was wonderful grace to him, that he should have this blessing to be righteous in an age so sadly corrupt, which was the cause of his being saved; for whoever are justified shall be saved eternally, Romans 8:30   as well as they are often saved from temporal calamities, see Isaiah 3:10 . </p>

<p>Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens ,.... From hence it appears, that the distinction of clean and unclean beasts, at least for sacrifice, if not for food, was known before the flood, and so before the law of Moses; though some think this is said by anticipation, and as providing a large stock of such creatures for the propagation of their species; because they would be most serviceable to men both for food and sacrifice: but as it is certain that sacrifices were offered ever since the fall of man; by the same way, namely, by divine revelation, that men were taught to sacrifice creatures as typical of the sacrifice of Christ, they were directed what sort of creatures to offer, as were most suitable figures of him; those beasts that were clean, and used under the law, and so no doubt, at this time, were oxen, sheep, and goats: and these were to be taken into the ark by &quot;sevens&quot;, or &quot;seven seven&quot;F16&#1513;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;  &#1513;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;   &quot;septena septena&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus; &quot;septem septem&quot;, Vatablus, Drusius. ; either only three pairs, male and female, for procreation, and the seventh a male for sacrifice, when the flood was over; or rather fourteen, seven couple, an equal number of male and female, as Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom, that there might be enough for propagation; since a large number of them would be consumed, both for food and sacrifice: </p>
<p> the male and his female , or &quot;the man and his wife&quot;F17&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;  &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1514;&#1493;   &quot;virum et uxorem ejus&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus. ; which confirms the sense given, that there were seven pairs, or otherwise, if there had been an odd seventh, there would not have been a male and his female: </p>
<p> and of beasts that are not clean by two , or only two: </p>
<p> the male and his female , or &quot;the man and his wife&quot;; which was a number sufficient for the propagation of creatures neither used for food nor sacrifice; and many of which are harmful to mankind, as lions, wolves, tigers, bears, &c. </p>

<p> and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights : this was not an ordinary but an extraordinary rain, in which the power and providence of God were eminently concerned, both with respect to the continuance of it, and the quantity of water that fell: </p>

<p>In the six hundredth year of Noah's life ,.... Not complete, but current, for otherwise Noah would have lived after the flood three hundred and fifty one years, whereas he lived but three hundred and fifty; Genesis 9:28 . </p>
<p> in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month : as the Jews had two ways of beginning their year, one at the spring, and the other at autumn; the one on ecclesiastical accounts, which began at Nisan, and which answers to March and April; and then the second month must be Ijar, which answers to part of April and part of May: and the other on civil accounts, which began at Tisri, and answers to part of September and part of October; and then the second month must be Marchesvan, which answers to part of October and part of November; so they are divided about this month in which the flood was: one says it was Marchesvan; another that it was IjarF20In Bab. Roshhashanah, fol. 11. 2. ; a third in particular saysF21Pirke Eliezer, c. 23.  it was on the tenth of Marchesvan that all the creatures came together into the ark, and on the seventeenth the waters of the flood descended on the earth; and this is most likely, since this was the most ancient way of beginning the year; for it was not until after the Jews came out of Egypt that they began their year in Nisan on sacred accounts; and besides the autumn was a proper time for Noah's gathering in the fruits of the earth, to lay up in the ark, as well as for the falling of the rains; though others think it was in the spring, in the most pleasant time of the year, and when the flood was least expected: the Arabic writersF23Elmacinus, p. 11. apud Hottinger. p. 251. Abulpharag. Hist. Dynast. p. 8. , contrary to both, and to the Scripture, say, that Noah, with his sons, and their wives, and whomsoever the Lord bid him take into the ark, entered on a Friday, the twenty seventh day of the month Adar or Agar: according to the Chaldean account by BerosusF24Apud Syncell. p. 30, 31. , it was predicted that mankind would be destroyed by a flood on the fifteenth of the month Daesius, the second month from the vernal equinox: it is very remarkable what PlutarchF25De Iside & Osir.  relates, that Osiris went into the ark the seventeenth of Athyr, which month is the second after the autumnal equinox, and entirely agrees with the account of Moses concerning Noah: according to Bishop Usher, it was on the seventh of December, on the first day of the week; others the sixth of November; with Mr. Whiston the twenty eighth: </p>
<p> the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened ; and by both these the flood of waters was brought upon the earth, which drowned it, and all the creatures in it: by the former are meant the vast quantities of subterraneous waters, which are more or greater than we know; and might be greater still at the time of the deluge:&quot;there are large lakes, (as Seneca observesF26Nat. Quaest. l. 3. c. 30. ,) which we see not, much of the sea that lies hidden, and many rivers that slide in secret:'so that those vast quantities of water in the bowels of the earth being pressed upwards, by the falling down of the earth, or by some other cause unknown to us, as Bishop Patrick observes, gushed out violently in several parts of the earth, where holes and gaps were made, and where they either found or made a vent, which, with the forty days' rain, might well make such a flood as here described: it is observedF1Bedford's Scripture Chronology, c. 12. p. 154. , there are seas which have so many rivers running into them, which must be emptied in an unknown manner, by some subterraneous passages, as the Euxine sea; and particularly it is remarked of the Caspian sea, reckoned in length to be above one hundred and twenty German leagues, and in breadth from east to west about ninety, that it has no visible way for the water to run out, and yet it receives into its bosom near one hundred rivers, and particularly the great river Volga, which is of itself like a sea for largeness, and is supposed to empty so much water into it in a year's time, as might suffice to cover the whole earth, and yet it is never increased nor diminished, nor is it observed to ebb or flow: so that if, says my author, the fountains of the great deep, or these subterraneous passages, were continued to be let loose, without any reflux into them, as Moses supposes, during the time of the rain of forty days and forty nights; and the waters ascended but a quarter of a mile in an hour; yet in forty days it would drain all the waters for two hundred and forty miles deep; which would, no doubt, be sufficient to cover the earth above four miles high: and by the former, &quot;the windows&quot; or flood gates of heaven, or the &quot;cataracts&quot;, as the Septuagint version, may be meant the clouds, as Sir Walter RaleighF2History of the World. B. l. c. 7. sect. 6.  interprets them; Moses using the word, he says, to express the violence of the rains, and pouring down of waters; for whosoever, adds he, hath seen those fallings of water which sometimes happen in the Indies, which are called &quot;the spouts&quot;, where clouds do not break into drops, but fall with a resistless violence in one body, may properly use that manner of speech which Moses did, that the windows or flood gates of heaven were opened, or that the waters fell contrary to custom, and that order which we call natural; God then loosened the power retentive in the uppermost air, and the waters fell in abundance: and another writer upon this observesF3Bedford's Scripture Chronology. p. 153. See Scheuchzer. Physica, vol. 1. p. 45. Ray's Physico-Theolog. Discourses, Disc. 2. c. 2. p. 71. , that thick air is easily turned into water; and that round the earth there is a thicker air, which we call the &quot;atmosphere&quot;; which, the further it is distant from the earth, the thinner it is, and so it grows thinner in proportion, until it loseth all its watery quality: how far this may extend cannot be determined; it may reach as far as the orb of the moon, for aught we know to the contrary; now when this retentive quality of waters was withdrawn, Moses tells us, that &quot;the rain was upon the earth forty days&quot; and &quot;forty nights&quot;: and therefore some of it might come so far as to be forty days in falling; and if we allow the rain a little more than ten miles in an hour, or two hundred and fifty miles in a day, then all the watery particles, which were 10,000 miles high, might descend upon the earth; and this alone might be more than sufficient to cover the highest mountains. (We now know that the earth's atmosphere does not extent more than a few miles above the earth's surface, before thinning out rapidly. If all the water vapour in our present atmosphere fell as rain, the ground would be covered to an average depth of less than two inchesF4The Genesis Flood, Whitcomb and Morris, 1978, The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, p. 121. . Even if there was a vapour canopy, this would not be a major source or water. Most of the water came from subterranean sources or volcanic activity. We know that volcanic eruptions spew much steam and water vapour into the atmosphere. This would later fall as rain. For a complete discussion of this see the book in footnoteF5Ib. . Ed.) </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 8  </p>
<p> This chapter gives an account of the going off of the waters from the earth, and of the entire deliverance of Noah, and those with him in the ark, from the flood, when all the rest were destroyed: after an one hundred and fifty days a wind is sent over the earth, the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven are stopped, the waters go off gradually, and the ark rests on Mount Ararat, Genesis 8:1   two months and thirteen days after that the tops of the mountains were seen, Genesis 8:5   and forty days after the appearance of them, Noah sent forth first a raven, and then a dove, and that a second time, to know more of the abatement of the waters, Genesis 8:6 . When Noah had been in the ark ten months and thirteen days, he uncovered it, and the earth was dry, yet not so dry as to be fit for him to go out upon, until near two months after, Genesis 8:13   when he had an order from God to go out of the ark, with all that were with him, which was accordingly obeyed, Genesis 8:15   upon which he offered sacrifice by way of thankfulness for his great deliverance, which was accepted by the Lord; who promised him not to curse the earth any more, nor to drown it, but that it should remain, and as long as it did there would be the constant revolutions of the seasons of the year, and of day and night, Genesis 8:20 . </p>

<p>And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark ,.... Not that God had forgotten Noah, for he does not, and cannot forget his creatures, properly speaking; but this is said after the manner of men, and as it might have seemed to Noah, who having heard nothing of him for five months, and having been perhaps longer in the ark than he expected, might begin to think that he was forgotten of God; but God remembered him, and his covenant with him, and the promise that he had made to him, that he and his family, and all the living creatures in the ark, should be preserved alive during the flood, Genesis 6:17   and God may be said particularly to remember him, and them, when he began to take measures for removing the waters from the earth, as he did by sending a wind, next mentioned: and thus God's helping his people when in difficulties and in distress, and delivering out of them, is called his remembrance of them; and he not only remembered Noah and his family, who are included in him, but every living creature also, which is expressed; for as the creatures suffered in the flood for the sins of men, so those in the ark were remembered and preserved for the sake of Noah and his family, and the world of men that should spring from them: </p>
<p> and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged ; not a stormy blustering one, that would have endangered the ark, but a gentle, hot, drying one; which stopped the increase of the waters, and made them less, and both drove away the rain, as the north wind does, as this perhaps wasF18------------for clouds were fled, Driv'n by a keen north wind, that, blowing dry, Wrinkled the face of Deluge, as decay'd. Milton, B. 11. l. 841, &c. , and caused the waters to move wards their proper channels and receptacles: this was the work of God, who has the command of the winds and waters, brings the former out of his storehouses, and restrains the latter at his pleasure; and this wind had this effect to assuage the waters, not from its own nature, but was attended with the mighty power of God to make it effectual, in an extraordinary manner: and it was, as the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem call it, &quot;a wind of mercies&quot;, or a merciful wind; or a wind of comforts, as Jarchi; for so it was to Noah and his family, and to all the creatures, since it served to dry up the waters of the flood, and caused them to subside. </p>

<p>The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven, were stopped ,.... The passages which let out the subterraneous waters in great quantity upon the earth, and the clouds of heaven, which poured down water upon it like spouts, were stopped from sending forth any more, as they had from the first of the flood unto one hundred and fifty days from thence: Jarchi observes, that it is not said that &quot;all&quot; the fountains of the deep, as when they were broken up, Genesis 7:11   because some of them were left open for the use and benefit of the world; besides, some must be left for the return of the waters: </p>
<p> and the rain from heaven was restrained : which seems to confirm what has been before observed, that after the rain of forty days and nights it ceased not to rain, more or less, though not so vehemently, until the end of an hundred and fifty days, and then it entirely ceased. </p>

<p>And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month ,.... That is, five months after the flood began, and when the waters began to decrease; for this is not the seventh month of the flood, but of the year, which being reckoned from Tisri, or the autumnal equinox, must be the month Nisan, which answers to part of our March, and part of April; and so the Targum of Jonathan explains it,&quot;this is the month Nisan;'but Jarchi makes it to be the month Sivan, which answers to part of May, and part of June, taking it to be the seventh month from Cisleu, when the forty days' rain ceased; in which he is followed by Dr. LightfootF21Works. vol. 1. p. 8. ; and according to Bishop UsherF23Annales Vet. Test. p. 4.  the seventeenth day of the seventh month, on which the ark rested, was Wednesday the sixth of May: and then it rested </p>
<p> upon the mountains of Ararat ; that is, on one of them, for Ararat is said to be a long ridge of mountains like the Alps, or the Pyrenean mountains; which, as Sir Walter RaleighF24History of the World, B. 1. ch. 7. sect. 13.  thinks, are the same which run through Armenia, Mesopotamia, Assyria, &c. and are by PlinyF25Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 27.  called Taurus. But what is now called Ararat, and by the Armenians Messis or Macis, and by the Turks Augri-daugh or Agrida, is a single mountain, and is so high that it overtops all the mountains thereabout; and that which makes it seem so very high is, that it stands by itself in the form of a sugar loaf, in the middle of one of the greatest plains one can see; it has two tops, one greater, and the smaller is most sharp pointed of the twoF26Cartwright's Preacher's Travels, p. 32. Tournefort's Voyage to the Levant, vol. 3. p. 177, 183, 186. . The Vulgate Latin version renders it the mountains of Armenia; and so Ararat in the Septuagint of Isaiah 37:38   is rendered Armenia, and in our version also; and it is the more commonly received opinion, that Ararat was a mountain there; and this agrees with the testimonies of various Heathen writers, which are produced by Josephus and Eusebius. Berosus the ChaldeanF1Apud Joseph. Antiqu. l. 1. c. 3. sect. 6.  says,&quot;it is reported that in Armenia, on a mountain of the Cordyaeans, there is part of a ship, the pitch of which some take off, and carry about with them, and use it as an amulet to avert evils.'And Nicholas of DamascusF2Apud ib.  relates, that in Minyas in Armenia is an huge mountain called Baris, to which, as the report is, many fled at the flood, and were saved; and that a certain person, carried in an ark or chest, struck upon the top of it, and that the remains of the timber were preserved a long time after; and, adds he, perhaps he may be the same that Moses, the lawgiver of the Jews, writes of. Now this mountain seems plainly to have its name from the ark of Noah, for a boat, or ship, is, with the Egyptians, called Baris. HerodotusF3Euterpe sive, l. 2. c. 96.  gives a large account of ships they call by this name; and the boat in which Charon is said to carry the dead bodies over the lake Acherusia, near Memphis, is said by Diodorus SiculusF4Bibliothec. l. 1. p. 87.  to have the same name. Abydenus the AssyrianF5Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 9. c. 12. p. 414, 415.  tells us, that&quot;Saturn having foretold to Sisithrus, that there would be a vast quantity of rain on the fifteenth of the month Daesius, he immediately sailed to the Armenians; and that the ship being driven to Armenia, the inhabitants made amulets of the wood of it, which they carried about their necks, as antidotes against diseases.'And hence MeloF6Apud ib. c. 19. p. 420. , who wrote against the Jews, suggests, as if the deluge did not reach Armenia; for he says,&quot;at the deluge a man that had escaped with his sons went from Armenia, being driven out of his possession by those of the country, and passing over the intermediate region, came into the mountainous part of Syria, which was desolate.'And with what Berosus says of a mountain of the Cordyaeans, in Armenia, agree the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, and the Syriac and Arabic versions, who all render the words here the mountains of Cardu or Carda: from the resting of the ark on this day on the mountains of Ararat, Jarchi concludes, and Dr. LightfootF7Ut supra, (Works. vol. 1.) p. 8.  after him, that the ark drew eleven cubits water, which, according to them, thus appears; on the first day of the month Ab, the mountain tops were first seen, and then the waters had fallen fifteen cubits, which they had been sixty days in doing, namely, from the first day of Sivan, and so they had abated the proportion of one cubit in four days: by this account we find, that on the sixteenth day of Sivan they had abated but four cubits, and yet on the next day, the seventeenth, the ark resteth on a hill, where the waters yet lay eleven cubits above it. </p>

<p>And he sent forth a raven ,.... That by it he might make his observation, how high or low the waters were upon the earth; and the rather he sent out the raven, a bird of prey, which feeds on carrion, that if the earth had been dry, the smell of the dead carcasses would have invited it to go far off from the ark, and not return; but if not, he would see it again: </p>
<p> which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from the earth ; or, &quot;and it went forth, going forth and returning&quot;F12&#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;  &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1488;  &#1493;&#1513;&#1493;&#1489;   &quot;et exiit egrediende et redeundo&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, Schmidt. ; it went forth out of the ark, and returned, but might not go into it, but went forth again, and then returned; and thus it continued going backwards and forwards, until the waters were dried up, when it returned no more: the Septuagint version is, &quot;and it returned not&quot;; and so some Jewish writersF13Pirke Eliezer, c. 23.  say, it found the carcass of a man on the top of the mountains, and sat upon it for food, and returned not: hence came the fable of Apollo's sending a raven to fetch water, while he was sacrificing, which lighting on a large corn field, yet green, and being willing to enjoy some grains of it, waited till it was ripe, and neglected its ordersF14Aelian. Var. Hist. l. 1. c. 47. ; and hence is the proverb, &quot;corvus nuntius&quot;. Some make this creature to be an emblem of the law, first sent forth, but brought no good tidings of the waters of God's wrath being assuaged, but worketh wrath, and is the ministration of condemnation and death: rather it is an emblem of unregenerate men, who are, like it, black through original sin and actual transgressions; are unclean and polluted in all the powers and faculties of their souls; are hateful, hating one another, and live in carnal and sensual lusts pleasures. </p>

<p>Also he sent forth a dove from him ,.... Seven days after he had sent out the raven, as in Genesis 8:10 . </p>
<p> to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ; for the dove is a creature that delights in cleanness, flies low, and goes far off, so that if it returned not again, he might conclude that the waters were gone off the earth; but being a sociable creature, and familiar to men, and especially loving to its mate, if they were not gone off, it would certainly return again. This some take to be an emblem of the Gospel, bringing the good tidings of peace, pardon, righteousness and salvation by Jesus Christ: rather it is an emblem of a sensible sinner, and true believer in Christ, being mournful, timorous, swift, modest, and affectionate; such persons, like doves of the valley, mourn for their iniquities; tremble at the sight of their sins, and the curses of the law, at the apprehension of divine wrath, at the awful judgment of God; and are fearful lest Christ should not receive them, to whom they swiftly fly for refuge, as doves to their windows; and who are modest, meek, and lowly, and affectionate to Christ, and one another. The Targum of Jonathan calls this an house dove, or tame one: hence, perhaps, came the practice of making use of doves as messengers to carry letters from place to placeF15Plin. Nat.

<p>But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark ,.... It being a creature that feeds upon seeds it picks off from the ground, and loving cleanness, it could find no place where it could alight, and have food to live upon, and retain its cleanness; for though the tops of the mountains were clear of the waters, yet they might be muddy and filthy with what the waters had raised up in them, or left upon them; and therefore it returned to Noah again, and not only like the raven unto the ark, but into it: </p>
<p> for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : there was no place dry, and so neither food nor footing for this creature; and which was an emblem of a sensible sinner, who finds no rest in anything short of Christ; not in worldly enjoyments; nor in external duties, not in hearing, reading, praying, fasting, nor in external humiliation and tears; nor in the law, and in the works of it; nor in natural descent, nor in education principles, nor in a profession of religion, and subjection to ordinances; only in Christ, where it finds rest from the burden and guilt of sin, and the tyrannical power of it; from the bondage, curse, and condemnation of the law, and from a sense of divine wrath and fear of it; and though not from afflictions, yet it finds rest in Christ amidst them: </p>
<p> then he put forth his hand and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark : she hovered about it, and got near the window, which Noah opened and took her in; which may represent the gracious reception sensible souls meet with from Christ, who apply to him; he kindly embraces them, and they find room in his heart and affections, fulness of everything they want, and security from all danger. </p>

<p>And the dove came in to him in the evening ,.... It having been out all day delighting itself in a free air, and perching upon the trees, but yet not finding sufficient food, or a proper lodging, it returned to Noah at the evening for food and dwelling in the ark: </p>
<p> and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off : which might easily be done, and even an &quot;olive branch&quot;, as the word sometimes signifies, and is by someF16&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;  &#1494;&#1497;&#1514;   &quot;ramum olivae&quot;, V. L. so Ainsworth, see Neh. viii. 15.  rendered; for it being now the summer season, young branches sprouted out, which being tender, were easily cropped: the Targum of Jonathan adds,&quot;which it had took from the mount of Olives;'but there is no necessity to suppose it went so far from the ark, since Assyria, a country nearer, was a land of olive oil, like that of Judea; 2 Kings 18:32   and besides, olives grew in Armenia itself, where the ark rested. Gogarene, in Armenia, is said by StraboF17Geograph. l. 11. p. 363.  to produce olive trees; though a modern author saysF18Tournefort's Voyage to the Levant, vol. 3. p. 173. &quot;I do not see where the dove which was sent out of the ark could find an olive branch, if the ark be supposed to have rested on Mount Ararat, or any of the mountains in Armenia; for this sort of trees is not found hereabout, where the species must be lost, and yet olives are known to be a kind of trees which never die:'but the above accounts show it to be otherwise in ancient times: </p>
<p> so Noah knew the waters were abated from off the earth : by this he perceived not only that they were gone off the mountains, but the lower grounds, at least the hills on which olive trees delight to grow; and yet that they were only abated, and not entirely gone off, since the dove returned to him: this dove sent out the second time, and returning, may be considered as an emblem of a Gospel minister, comparable to a dove, for the dove like gifts of the Spirit of God, by which he is qualified for his work, and for his simplicity, harmlessness, meekness, and humility; and the olive leaf in its mouth may be an emblem of the Gospel, which is from Christ, the good olive; is the Gospel of peace, which an olive branch is a symbol of, proclaiming and publishing peace and reconciliation by Christ; and as that is ever green, the Gospel always continues, and is the everlasting Gospel, and which was brought, and more fully and clearly dispensed in the evening of the world; and by it, it is known that the waters of divine wrath are assuaged, and the people of God may be assured they will never return to come upon them. </p>

<p>And he stayed yet other seven days ,.... After the dove had returned: </p>

<p> which returned not again unto him any more : the earth being dry, it found rest for the sole of its feet, sufficient food to eat, and a proper place for its habitation; and liking to be at liberty, and in the open air, chose not to return to the ark, even though its mate was there: of those birds sent out, the Heathen writers make mention: Abydenus saysF19Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 12. p. 414,415. , that Sisithrus, the same with Noah, sent out birds making an experiment to see whether the earth was emersed out of the water, which returned again to him; and after them he sent out others; and having done so three times, obtained what he wished for, since the birds returned with their wings full of clay or mud; and so JosephusF20Antiqu. l. 1. c. 3. p. 5.  says, the dove which brought the olive leaf was all over with clay or mud: and PlutarchF21De Solert. Animal.  makes particular mention of the dove, and says that, according to the mythologists, a dove was let out of the ark; and that her going out was to Deucalion, (the same with Noah) a sign of fair weather, and her return of foul: and the story that LucianF23De Dea Syria.  tells of a golden dove upon the head of a statue in the temple of Hierapolis, supposed to be Deucalion's, seems plainly to refer to this dove of Noah; for the report, he says, was, that this golden dove flew away twice in a year, at the commemoration there made of the flood, by pouring out abundance of water into a chasm or cleft of the earth, then not very large; and which, it was told him, was formerly a very great one, and swallowed up all the flood that drowned the world. </p>

<p>And it came to pass, in the six hundred and first year ,.... Of Noah's life, and so the Septuagint adds, in the first month: </p>
<p> the first day of the month ; so that it was the first day of the year, New Year's Day, and a joyful one it was to Noah and his family, when they saw dry ground; which they had not seen for above ten months: according to R. Joshua, this was the month Nisan, which was the first month with the Jews on sacred accounts; but according to R. Eliezer it was the month of Tisri, as Jarchi observes, which was their first month on civil accounts, and was their most ancient way of reckoning; and so the Targum of Jonathan explains it, adding, and Tisri; which answers to part of September, and part of October; and according to Bishop UsherF24Ut supra. (Annales Vet. Test. p. 4.) , this day was Friday, October 23, A. M. 1657: </p>
<p> the waters were dried up from off the earth : by the wind that continued to pass over it, and by the sun, which exhaled great quantities of it throughout the whole summer season; as it was from the end of the one hundred days, when the wind was first made, and the waters began to assuage to this time; as well as also by their soaking into the earth, and by returning to the cavities and receptacles in it: </p>
<p> and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked ; not the roof of it, at least not the whole, only a board or two; though perhaps this was a covering made of skins, that was thrown over the ark, like that which was put over the tabernacle of Moses, and was made of skins, Exodus 26:14   where the same word is used as here: the use of this might be to hang over the window and defend it from the rain; so that the uncovering of the ark was only putting by, or turning up this covering, that he might be able more clearly to see, out of the window, how things were: </p>
<p> and, behold, the face of the ground was dry ; the ground or surface of the earth looked dry; but was not so dry and hard as to bear heavy bodies, or the foot to tread on it, being soft and tender, through the water so long upon it, and had left mud and slime, not yet sufficiently hardened by the wind and sun to walk upon. </p>

Jarchi observes, it is said &quot;on the earth&quot;, not in the ark, which shows he thinks that birds and beasts were not allowed to couple, and that they did not breed there. It is a question with some, how the creatures, which were only in Asia at their coming out of the ark, could spread themselves all over the earth; particularly how they could get into islands, and especially into America: to which it may be answered, that this might be done by many of them, by swimming over narrow seas, for some wild creatures will swim whole days and nights together, when they are forced to it; and by men's carrying others in vessels to distant and different parts, on one account or another, either for profit or pleasure; and especially, what is it the power and providence of God cannot do, who could not be at a loss for ways and means to replenish a world in all the parts of it he had made desolate, when it was his pleasure?(Most creationists think the earth entered an ice age after the flood. This would make the sea level lower than it is today. If the average sea level was lowered by only six hundred feet, all the major continents would be connected by land bridges.

<p> and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar ; the clean beasts were the bullock, the sheep, and goat, and the clean fowl, the turtle and young pigeon, one of each sort at least was taken.

Or a &quot;savour of rest&quot;F5&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;  &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495;   &quot;odorem quietis&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, Munster, &c. ; he was delighted and well pleased with his sacrifice, which was offered up in the faith of the sacrifice of Christ; the apostle says, &quot;is for a sweetsmelling savour&quot;, Ephesians 5:2   referring to this passage; that being a satisfaction to the justice of God, an appeasing of his wrath, and a propitiation for the sins of men: </p>
<p> and the Lord said in his heart ; within himself; it was awhile a secret there, but Noah being a prophet, as Aben Ezra observes, he revealed it to him, or &quot;to his heart&quot;F6&#1488;&#1500;  &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;   &quot;ad cor suum&quot;, Montanus, Tigurine version; &quot;prophetae suo&quot;, Arab. , that is, to the heart of Noah, as some interpret it, he spoke comfortably to him, as follows, when the Jewish writersF7Jarchi in loc. Pirke Eliezer, c. 23.  say he stretched out his right hand and swore, agreeably to Isaiah 54:9 . </p>
<p> I will not again curse the ground for man's sake , or drown it for the sin of man, as he had cursed it for the sin of Adam, and which continued till this time; but now was taken off, and it became more fruitful, and very probably by means of the waters which had been so long upon it, and had left a fructifying virtue in it, as the waters of the Nile do in Egypt. Some interpret the phrase, &quot;for man's sake&quot;, for the man Christ's sake, for the sake of his sacrifice, of which Noah's was a type, and the sense be, that God would no more curse the earth; for by his sacrifice the curse of the law is removed, with respect to his people; they are redeemed from it, and shall inherit that new earth, of which this earth, renewed after the flood, was a type, in which there will be no more curse, Revelation 21:1   which sense, though evangelical, cannot be admitted, because of the reason following, unless the first word be rendered &quot;though&quot;, as it may: </p>
<p> for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth ; his nature is depraved, his heart is corrupt, the thoughts of it evil, yea, the imagination of it, and of them, is sinful, and that originally, even from his birth; from the time he is shook out of his mother's womb, as Jarchi interprets the phrase: man is conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity, and is a transgressor from the womb, and so a child of wrath, and deserving of the curse of the law upon himself, and all that belong to him; and yet this is given as a reason why God will not any more curse the ground for his sake: that which was a reason for destroying the earth, is now one against it, see Genesis 6:5   which may be reconciled thus, God for this reason destroyed the earth once, for an example, and to display his justice; but such is his clemency and mercy, that he will do it no more to the end of the world; considering that man has brought himself into such a condition, that he cannot but sin, it is natural to him from his birth; his nature is tainted with it, his heart is full of it, and all his thoughts and imaginations are wicked and sinful, from whence continually flow a train of actual sins and transgressions; so that if God was to curse and drown the world as often as man sins, he must be continually doing it; for the words may be rendered, &quot;though the imagination of man's heart is evil&quot;, &c.F8&#1499;&#1497;   &quot;quamvis&quot;, Piscator; so Ainsworth. ; yet I will not do it; and so they are expressive of the super abounding grace of God over abounding sin: </p>
<p> neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done ; this hinders not but that there might be, as has been since, partial calamities, or particular judgments on individual persons, towns, and cities, as those of Sodom and Gomorrah, or partial inundations, but not a general deluge, or an universal destruction of the world and creatures in it, at least not by water, as has been, but by fire, as will be; for that the earth will have an end, at least as to its present nature, form, and use, may be concluded from the following words. </p>

<p>While the earth remaineth ,.... Which as to its substance may remain for ever, Ecclesiastes 1:4   yet as to its form and quality will be changed; that and all in it will be burnt up; there will be an end of all things in it, for so the words are in the original, &quot;as yet all the days of the earth&quot;, or &quot;while all the days of the earth&quot; areF9&#1506;&#1491;  &#1499;&#1500;  &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;  &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;   &quot;cunctis diebus terrae&quot;, V. L. &quot;adhuc omnes dies terrae&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus; so Drusius, Cocceius. ; which shows that there is a time fixed for its continuance, and that this time is but short, being measured by days: but however, as long as it does continue: </p>
<p> seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease ; as they had done, or seemed to do during the flood; for the year past there had been no seedtime nor harvest, and it must have been for the most part damp and cold, through the rains, and the abundance of water on earth, that the difference of seasons was not very discernible; as neither of days and nights at some times, especially when the clouds were so black and thick over the heavens, that neither sun, moon, or stars could be seen; and such floods of water continually pouring down, that it must be difficult to know when it was day, and when night; but for the future it is promised, that these should not cease as long as the world stands: &quot;seedtime and harvest&quot;; the time of sowing seed in the earth, and the time of gathering in the fruits of it when ripe, so necessary for the sustenance of man and beast: once in seven years, and once in fifty years indeed, these ceased in the land of Judea, while the people of Israel resided there; but then this was not general all the world over, in other places there were seedtime and harvest: &quot;and cold and heat, and summer and winter&quot;; in some places indeed there is but little cold, in others but little heat, and the difference of summer and winter is not so discernible in some places as in others, yet there is of all these in the world in general. According to Jarchi, &quot;cold&quot; signifies a more severe season than &quot;winter&quot;, or the severer part of the winter; and &quot;heat&quot; a hotter season than the summer, or the hotter part of it. The Jews observe, that the seasons of the year are divided into six parts, and two months are to be allowed to each part; which Lyra, from them, and chiefly from Jarchi, thus gives,&quot;to seedtime the last half of September, all October, and half November; to cold, the other half of November, all December, and half January; to winter, half January, all February, and half March: to harvest, half March, all April, and half May; to summer, half May, all June, and half July; to heat, half July, all August, and the first half of September.'But these accounts refer to the land of Judea only: it is enough for the fulfilment of the promise, that they are more or less, at one time of the year or another, in all parts of the world, and so will be until the world shall be no more; and may, in a mystic sense, denote the continuance of the church of God in the world, as long as it endures, and its various vicissitudes and revolutions; sometimes it is a time of sowing the precious seed of the Word; and sometimes it is an harvest, is an ingathering of souls into it; sometimes it is a winter season with it, and all things seem withered and dead; and at other times it is summer, and all things look smiling and cheerful; sometimes it is in a state of coldness and indifference, and at other times exposed to the heat of persecution, and more warm and zealous usually then; sometimes it is night with it, and sometimes day, and so it is like to be, until that state takes place described in Revelation 7:16 . </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 9  </p>
<p> In this chapter we have an account of God's blessing Noah and his sons, being just come out of the ark, with a renewal of the blessing of propagating their species, and replenishing the earth, the dominion over the creatures, and a freedom from the fear of them; with liberty to eat flesh, only it must not be eaten with blood; with a providential care and preservation of their lives from men and beasts, by making a law that that man or beast should die that shed man's blood, Genesis 9:1   and after repeating the blessing of procreation, Genesis 9:7   mention is made of a covenant God made with Noah, his sons, and all the creatures, that he would drown the world no more, the token of which should be the rainbow in the cloud, Genesis 9:8   the names of the sons of Noah are observed, by whom the earth was repeopled, Genesis 9:18   and seem to be observed for the sake of an event after recorded; Noah having planted a vineyard, and drank too freely of the wine of it, lay down uncovered in his tent, which Ham seeing, told his two brothers of it, who in a very modest manner covered him, Genesis 9:20   of all which Noah being sensible when he awoke, cursed Canaan the son of Ham, and blessed Shem and Japheth, Genesis 9:24   and the chapter is concluded with the age and death of Noah, Genesis 9:28 . </p>

<p>And God blessed Noah and his sons ,.... With temporal blessings, not spiritual ones; for though some of them were blessed with such, yet not all, particularly Ham: </p>
<p> and said unto them, be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth ; depopulated by the flood: this is a renewal of the blessing on Adam, a power and faculty of propagating his species, which was as necessary now as then, since there were so few of the human race left in the world; and the renewal of this grant was the rather necessary, if, as has been observed, Noah and his sons were restrained from cohabiting with their wives while in the ark: but though these words are not an express command for the propagation of their species, yet more than a bare permission, at least they are a direction and instruction to it, and even carry in them a promise of fruitfulness, that they should multiply and increase, which was very needful at this time. </p>

<p>And the fear or you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth ,.... This is a renewal, at least in part, of the grant of dominion to Adam over all the creatures; these obeyed him cheerfully, and from love, but sinning, he in a good measure lost his power over them, they rebelled against him; but now though the charter of power over them is renewed, they do not serve man freely, but are in dread of him, and flee from him; some are more easily brought into subjection to him, and even the fiercest and wildest of them may be tamed by him; and this power over them was the more easily retrieved in all probability by Noah and his sons, from the inhabitation of the creatures with them for so long a time in the ark: </p>
<p> and upon every fowl of the air, and upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea ; as appears by fowls flying away, by beasts and creeping things getting off as fast as they can, and by fishes swimming away at the sight of men: </p>
<p> into your hand are they delivered ; as the lords and proprietors of them, for their use and service, and particularly for what follows, see Psalm 8:6   where there is an enumeration of the creatures subject to men. </p>
<h2 pb_toc="index">9:3</h2>
<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 9:3" display="now" /><b>Gen 9:3</b></p>


<p>Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ,.... That is, every beast, fowl, and fish, without exception; for though there was a difference at this time of clean and unclean creatures with respect to sacrifice, yet not with respect to food; every creature of God was good then, as it is now, and it was left to man's reason and judgment what to make use of, as would be most conducive to his health, and agreeable to his taste: and though there was a distinction afterwards made under the Levitical dispensation among the Jews, who were forbid the use of some creatures; yet they themselves sayF11In Bereshit Rabba, apud Ainsworth in loc. , that all unclean beasts will be clean in the world to come, in the times of the Messiah, as they were to the sons of Noah, and refer to this text in proof of it; the only exception in the text is, that they must be living creatures which are taken, and used for food; not such as die of themselves, or are torn to pieces by wild beasts, but such as are taken alive, and killed in a proper manner: </p>
<p> even as the green herb have I given you all things ; as every green herb was given for meat to Adam originally, without any exception, Genesis 1:29   so every living creature, without exception, was given to Noah and his sons for food. Some think, and it is a general opinion, that this was a new grant, that man had no right before to eat flesh, nor did he; and it is certain it is not before expressed, but it may be included in the general grant of power and dominion over the creatures made to Adam; and since what is before observed is only a renewal of former grants, this may be considered in the same light; or otherwise the dominion over the creatures first granted to Adam will be reduced to a small matter, if he had no right nor power to kill and eat them; besides, in so large a space of time as 1600 years and upwards, the world must have been overstocked with creatures, if they were not used for such a purpose; nor will Abel's offering the firstling and fattest of his flock appear so praiseworthy, when it made no difference with him, if he ate not of them, whether they were fat or lean; and who will deny that there were peace offerings before the flood, which the offerer always ate of? to which may be added the luxury of men before the flood, who thereby were given to impure and carnal lusts; and our Lord expressly says of the men of that age, that they were &quot;eating and drinking&quot;, living in a voluptuous manner, which can hardly be accounted for, if they lived only on herbs, see Luke 17:22   though it must be owned, that it was a common notion of poets and philosophersF12Pythagoras, apud Ovid. Metamorph. l. 15. Fab. 2. Porphyr. de abstinentia, l. 4. sect. 2. , that men in the golden age, as they call it, did not eat flesh, but lived on herbs and fruit. </p>

<p>But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat.  This is the only exception to the eating of flesh; it was not to be eaten with the blood in it, which is said to be its life; not that the blood is of itself the life, but because it is a means of life, and that being exhausted, the creature must die, and because the animal and vital spirits appear to us most vigorous in it; yea, it is the ailment and support of them, and which furnishes out the greatest quantity of them: or rather it may be rendered, &quot;the flesh with its life in its blood&quot;F13&#1493;&#1488;&#1498;  &#1489;&#1513;&#1512;  &#1489;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1493;  &#1491;&#1502;&#1493;   &quot;carnem cum anima, &quot;seu&quot; vita ejus, sanguine ejus&quot;, Cartwright. ; while there is life in the blood, or while the creature is living; the meaning is, that a creature designed for food should be properly killed, and its blood let out; that it should not be devoured alive, as by a beast of prey; that raw flesh should not be eaten, as since by cannibals, and might be by riotous flesh eaters, before the flood; for notwithstanding this law, as flesh without the blood might be eaten, so blood properly let out, and dressed, or mixed with other things, might be eaten, for aught this says to the contrary; but was not to be eaten with the flesh, though it might separately, which was afterwards forbid by another law. The design of this was to restrain cruelty in men, and particularly to prevent the shedding of human blood, which men might be led into, were they suffered to tear living creatures in pieces, and feed upon their raw flesh, and the blood in it. The Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;but the flesh which is torn from a living beast at the time that its life is in it, or which is torn from a beast while it is slain, before all its breath is gone out, ye shall not eat.'And the Jewish writers generally interpret this of the flesh of a creature taken from it alive, which, they say, is the seventh precept given to the sons of Noah, over and above the six which the sons of Adam were bound to observe, and they are these;1. Idolatry is forbidden. 2. Blasphemy is forbidden. 3. The shedding of blood, or murder is forbidden. 4. Uncleanness, or unjust carnal copulations is forbidden. 5. Rapine or robbery is forbidden. 6. The administration of justice to malefactors is required. 7. The eating of any member or flesh of a creature while aliveF14Maimon. Hilchot Melachim, c. 9. sect. 1.  is forbidden.Such of the Heathens who conformed to those precepts were admitted to dwell among the Israelites, and were called proselytes of the gate. </p>

<p>And surely your blood of your lives will I require ,.... Or &quot;for surely your blood&quot;, &c.F15   &#954;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#945;&#961; , Sept. &quot;enim&quot;, V. L. ; and so is a reason of the preceding law, to teach men not to shed human blood; or though, &quot;surely your blood&quot;, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra; though God had given them liberty to slay the creatures, and shed their blood, and eat them, yet he did not allow them to shed their own blood, or the blood of their fellow creatures; should they do this, he would surely make inquisition, and punish them for it: </p>
<p> at the hand of every beast will I require it ; should a beast kill a man, or be the instrument of shedding his blood, it should be slain for it; not by means of another beast, God so ordering it, as Aben Ezra suggests, but by the hands or order of the civil magistrate; which was to be done partly to show the great regard God has to the life of man, and partly to punish men for not taking more care of their beasts, as well as to be an example to others to be more careful, and to lessen, the number of mischievous creatures: </p>
<p> and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man ; which may be reasonably supposed; for if it is required of a beast, and that is punished for the slaughter of a man, then much more a man himself, that is wilfully guilty of murder; and the rather, since he is by general relation a brother to the person he has murdered, which is an aggravation of his crime: or it may signify, that though he is a brother in the nearest relation, as his crime is the greater, he shall not go unpunished. </p>

<p>Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed ,.... That is, he that is guilty of wilful murder shall surely be put to death by the order of the civil magistrate; so the Targum of Jonathan,&quot;by witnesses the judges shall condemn him to death,'that is, the fact being clearly proved by witnesses, the judges shall condemn&quot;him to death,'that is, the fact being clearly proved by witnesses, the judges shall pass the sentence of death upon him, and execute it; for this is but the law of retaliation, a just and equitable one, blood for blood, or life for life; though it seems to be the first law of this kind that empowered the civil magistrate to take away life; God, as it is thought, reserving the right and power to himself before, and which, for some reasons, he thought fit not to make use of in the case of Cain, whom he only banished, and suffered not others to take away his life, but now enacts a law, requiring judges to punish murder with death: and which, according to this law, ought never to go unpunished, or have a lesser punishment inflicted for it: the reason follows: </p>
<p> for in the image of God made he man ; which, though sadly defaced and obliterated by sin, yet there are such remains of it, as render him more especially the object of the care and providence of God, and give him a superiority to other creatures; and particularly this image, among others, consists in immortality, which the taking away of his life may seem to contradict; however, it is what no man has a right to do. </p>

Metamorph. l. 1. Fab. 7.  call the rainbow the messenger of Juno. It is a question whether there was a rainbow before the flood, and it is not easily answered; both Jews and Christians are divided about it; Saadiah thought there was one; but Aben Ezra disapproves of his opinion, and thinks it was first now made. The greater part of Christian interpreters are of the mind of Saadiah, that it was from the beginning, the natural causes of it, the sun and cloud, being before the flood; and that it was now after it only appointed to be a sign and token of the covenant; but though the natural causes of it did exist before, it does not follow, nor is it to be proved, that there was such a disposition of them to produce such an effect; and it might be so ordered in Providence, that there should not be any, that this might be entirely a new thing, and so a wonderful one, as the word for &quot;token&quot;F19&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;   &quot;signum, tam nudum, quam prodigiosum&quot;, Buxtorf.  signifies; and the Greeks calls the rainbow the &quot;daughter of Thaumas&quot; or &quot;Wonder&quot;F20Plato in Theaeeteto, Plutarch. de Placit, Philosoph. 3, 4.

<p> it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth ; that is, between God and the creatures of the earth; or of a promise that God would no more destroy the earth, and cut off the creatures in it by a flood; for though it is a bow, yet without arrows, and is not turned downwards towards the earth, but upwards towards heaven, and so is a token of mercy and kindness, and not of wrath and anger. </p>

<p> that the bow shall be seen in the cloud ; after it has pretty much discharged itself; for the rainbow is always in a thin, not a thick cloud; after the heavy showers are fallen from the thick clouds, and a small thin one remains, then the rainbow is seen in it; not always, but very frequently, and when the sun and clouds are in a proper position: and this is often so ordered, to put men in mind of this covenant, and to divest them of, or prevent their fears of the world being drowned by a flood; for when they see this, it is a sure sign the rain is going off, since the cloud is thinned, or otherwise the rainbow could not appear: and a most glorious and beautiful sight it is, having such a variety of colours in it, and in such a position and form. Some think that it serves both to put in mind of the destruction of the old world by water, through its watery colours, and of the present world by fire, through its fiery ones. Others make the three predominant colours to denote the three dispensations before the law, under the law, and under the Gospel: rather they may signify the various providences of God, which all work together for the good of his people; however, whenever this bow is seen, it puts in mind of the covenant of preservation made with all the creatures, and the firmness, stability, and duration of it; and is by some considered as an emblem of the covenant of grace, from Isaiah 54:9   which is of God's making, as this bow is; is a reverberation of Christ the sun of righteousness, the sum and substance of the covenant; consists of various blessings and promises of grace; is expressive of mercy and peace, and is a security from everlasting destruction: or rather it may be thought to be an emblem of Christ himself, who was seen by John clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, Revelation 10:1   this being a wonderful thing, as Christ is wonderful in his person, office, and grace; and as it has in it a variety of beautiful colours, it may represent Christ, who is full of grace and truth, and fairer than the children of men; and may be considered as a symbol of peace and reconciliation by him, whom God looks unto, and remembers the covenant of his grace he has made with him and his chosen ones in him; and who is the rainbow round about the throne of God, and the way of access unto it; Revelation 4:3   the Jews have a saying,&quot;till ye see the bow in its luminous colours, do not look for the feet of the Messiah, or his comingF23Tikkune Zohar, correct. 18. fol. 32. 2. correct. 37. fol. 81. 1. .' </p>

It may seem strange that Canaan should be cursed, and not Ham, who seems to he the only aggressor, by what is said in the context; hence one copy of the Septuagint, as Ainsworth observes, reads Ham, and the Arabic writers the father of Canaan; and so Saadiah Gaon supplies it, as Aben Ezra relates; and the same supplement is made by othersF18So some in Vatablus. : but as both were guilty, as appears from what has been observed on the former verses, and Canaan particularly was first in the transgression; it seems most wise and just that he should be expressly named, since hereby Ham is not excluded a share in the punishment of the crime he had a concern in, being punished in his son, his youngest son, who perhaps was his darling and favourite, and which must be very afflicting to him to hear of; and since Canaan only, and not any of the other sons of Ham were guilty, he, and not Ham by name, is cursed, lest it should be thought that the curse would fall upon Ham and all his posterity; whereas the curse descends on him, and very justly proceeds in the line of Canaan; and who is the rather mentioned, because he was the father of the accursed race of the Canaanites, whom God abhorred, and, for their wickedness, was about to drive out of their land, and give it to his people for an inheritance; and in order to which the Israelites were now upon the expedition, when Moses wrote this account, and which must animate them to it; for by this prediction they would see that they were an accursed people, and that they were to be their servants: </p>
<p> a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren ; the posterities of Shem and Japheth, who stood in the relation of brethren to Canaan and his posterity; and to those he and his offspring were to become the most mean abject servants, as the phrase implies: this character agrees with the name of Canaan, which may be derived from &#1499;&#1504;&#1506; , &quot;to depress&quot;, &quot;humble&quot;, and &quot;make mean and abject&quot;. </p>

Some understand this of God himself, he shall dwell in the tents of Shem, or in Israel, as Jarchi, and was verified remarkably in the incarnation of the Son of God: </p>

By this it appears, that he lived within thirty two years of the birth of Abraham.

<p> and unto them were sons born after the flood ; for they had none born to them either before the flood or in it; they were married before the flood, for their wives went into the ark with them; but it does not appear they had any children before, though they then were near an hundred years old; and if they had, they were not in the ark, and therefore must perish with the rest, which is not likely: Shem's son Arphaxad was born two years after the flood, Genesis 11:10   when the rest were born, either his or his brethren's, is not said; however they were all born after the flood; though some pretend that Canaan was born in the arkF25See Bayle's Dictionary, vol. 10. art. &quot;Ham&quot;, p. 587. , during the flood, for which there is no authority; yea, it is confuted in this chapter, where Canaan stands among the sons of Ham, born to him after the flood. </p>

According to JosephusF1Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1. , the sons of Japheth inhabited the earth, beginning from the mountains Taurus and Amanus, and then went on in Asia unto the river Tanais, and in Europe unto Gadira. Seven of his sons are mentioned, and the first is Gomer; from whom, according to the same writerF2Ib. , came the Gomareans or Gomerites, in his time called by the Greeks Galatians, that is, the Gauls of Asia minor, who inhabited Phrygia; both Gomer and Phrygia signifying the same, as BochartF3Phaleg. l. 3. c. 8. col. 171, 172.  observes, and the country looking as if it was torrified or burnt; and PlinyF4Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 30.  makes mention of a town in Phrygia, called Cimmeris; and the Cimmerians and Cimbri are derived by some from this Gomer, whom HerodotusF5Clio sive, l. 1. c. 16, 103. & Melpomene sive, l. 4. c. 11, 12, 13.  makes mention of as in Asia and Scythia, and speaks of a country called Cimmerius, and of the Cimmerian Bosphorus; and these seem to be the Gauls before mentioned, under a different name; and it is to be observed, that the Welsh, who sprung from the Gauls, call themselves to this day Cumero, or Cymro and Cumeri. It is plain from Ezekiel 38:6   that Gomer and his people lay to the north of Judea, and the posterity of Japheth went first into the northern parts of Asia, and then spread themselves into Europe: six more of his sons follow, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras; the first of these, Magog, was the father of a northern people which bore his name, see Ezekiel 38:2   and according to JosephusF6Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.) , who is generally followed, are the same that were called Scythians; from Madai came the Medes, often spoken of in Scripture, along with the Persians; so JosephusF7Ib.  says, from him came the nation of Madaeans, whom the Greeks call Medes; and very frequently in Scripture the Medes go by the name of Madai, their original ancestor; see Daniel 5:28   but Mr. MedeF8Dissert. 48.  is of opinion, that Macedonia was the seat of this Madai, which was formerly called Aemathia; that is, as he gives the etymology of it,    &#945;&#953;&#945; , &quot;Madai&quot;, the country of Madai; but the former sense is generally received. Javan is by all agreed to be the father of the Grecians; hence Alexander, king of Grecia, is in Daniel 8:21   called king of Javan; and one part of Greece bore the name of Ionia; and the sea that washed it is called the Ionian sea. And his posterity are    &#953;&#945;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#962; , &quot;Iaonians&quot;, in HomerF9Iliad. 13. ver. 685.  and AristophanesF11Acharneus. act. 1. scen. 3. p. 376. ; and the scholiast of the latter says, that the Barbarians call all Greeks Iaonians. The next son of Japheth is Tubal or Thobel, as Josephus calls him, who saysF12Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.  the Thobelians in his time were called Iberians, a people in Asia, that dwelt near the Euxine sea; and in Albania was a place called Thabilaca, as may be seen in PtolemyF13Geograph. l. 5. c. 12. , and another called Thilbis, from whom might spring the Iberians in Europe, now called Spaniards; but BochartF14Phaleg. l. 3. c. 12. col. 180.  thinks that the Tibarenes are the descendants of Tubal, a people that dwelt between the Trapezuntii and Armenia the less; and he wonders that this never was thought of by any; but in that he is mistaken, for our countryman Mr. BroughtonF15See his Works, p. 2, 58.  makes the Tibarenes to spring from Tubal; and EpiphaniusF16Ancorat. p. 546.  many hundreds of years before him. Meshech, his next son, is mentioned along with Tubal in Ezekiel 27:13   from him came the Mosocheni, as JosephusF17Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.) , who in his time were called Cappadocians, with whom there was a city then named Mazaca, since CaesareaF18Vid. Ammian. Marcellin. l. 20. p. 170. Ed. Vales. ; and these seem to be the same that PlinyF19Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 9, 10.  calls Moscheni, who inhabited the mountains Moschici, which were at the north east of Cappadocia. Some derive the Muscovites from them, which is not improbable: the last of Japheth's sons is Tiras or Thiras, which Jarchi interprets very wrongly by Paras, or Persia; much better the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem, and so a Jewish chronologerF20Sepher Juchasin, fol. 145. 1. Vid. T. Bab. Yoma, fol. 10. 1. , by Thracia; for the descendants of Thiras, as JosephusF21Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.)  observes, the Greeks call Thracians; and in Thrace was a river called AtyrasF23Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 4. c. 11. , which has in it a trace of this man's name; and Odrysus, whom the Thracians worshipped, is the same with Tiras, which god sometimes goes by the name of Thuras; and is one of the names of Mars, the god of the Thracians. </p>

<p>And the sons of Gomer ,.... Who was the first of the sons of Japheth, three of whose sons are mentioned, and they are as follow: </p>
<p> Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah ; the first of these seated himself in the lesser Asia, in Pontus and Bithynia, where were some traces of his name in the river Ascanius, and in the Ascanian lake or bay; and also in the lesser Phrygia or Troas, where was a city called Ascania, and where were the Ascanian islesF24Strabo Geograph. l. 12. p. 387, 388. & l. 14. p. 468. Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 4. 12. & 5. 30, 31, 32. , and the Euxine Pontus, or AxeineF25Vid. Orphei Argonautic, ver. 84. , as it was first called, which is the sea that separates Asia and Europe, and is no other than a corruption of the sea of Ashkenaz. It seems to have been near Armenia, by its being mentioned along with Minni or Armenia, in Jeremiah 51:27 . Germany is by the Jews commonly called Ashkenaz; perhaps some of the posterity of Ashkenaz in Asia might pass into Europe, and Germany might be a colony of them; so Mr. BroughtonF26See his Works, p. 2, 58.  observes of the sons of Gomer, that they first took their seat in Asia, and then came north and west into Muscovy and Germany. The next son of Gomer was Riphath. JosephusF1Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.)  says, that the Riphathaeans which came from him are the Paphlagonians, a people of Asia Minor, near Pontus, so that he settled near his brother Ashkenaz; perhaps his posterity are the Arimphaei of PlinyF2Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 2. , and the Riphaeans of MelaF3De Situ Orbis, l. 1. c. 2. , who inhabited near the Riphaean mountains, which might have their name from this son of Gomer, who in 1 Chronicles 1:6   is called Diphath, the letters &#1512;   and &#1491;   being very similar. His third son is called Togarmah, who had his seat in the north of Judea, see Ezekiel 38:6   his posterity are the Phrygians, according to JosephusF4Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.) ; but some place them in Galatia and Cappadocia; and StraboF5Geograph. l. 4. p. 130. & l. 12. p. 390.  makes mention of a people called Trocmi, on the borders of Pontus and Cappadocia; and CiceroF6De Divinatione, l. 2.  of the Trogmi or Trogini, who may have their name from hence; for the Greek interpreters always call him Torgama or Thorgana. The Jews make the Turks to be the posterity of Togarmah. Elias Levita saysF7In Tishbi, p. 259. , there are some that say that Togarmah is the land of Turkey; and Benjamin of TudelaF8ltinerarium, p. 27, 54.  calls a Turkish sultan king of the Togarmans, that is, the Turks; and among the ten families of Togarmah, which Josephus ben GorionF9Hist. Heb. l. 1. c. 1. p. 3.  speaks of, the Turks are one; and perhaps this notion may not be amiss, since the company of Togarmah is mentioned with Gog, or the Turk; see Gill on Ezekiel 38:6 . The Armenians pretend to be the descendants of Togarmah, who, with them, is the son of Tiras, the son of Gomer, by his son Haik, from whom they and their country, from all antiquity, have bore the name of HaikF11See the Universal History, vol. 1. p. 377. . </p>

<p>And the sons of Javan ,.... Another son of Japheth; four sons of Javan are mentioned, which gave names to countries, and are as follow: </p>
<p> Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim ; the first of these, Elishah, gave name to the Elysaeans, now called Aeoles, as JosephusF12Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.)  says; hence the country Aeolia, and the Aeolic dialect, all from this name; and there are many traces of it in the several parts of Greece. Hellas, a large country in it, has its name from him; so the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem interpret Elishah by Allas. Elis in Peloponnesus, Eleusis in Attica, the river Elissus, or Ilissus, and the Elysian fields, are so called from him. Tarshish, second son of Javan, gave name to Tarsus, by which Cilicia was formerly called, as Josephus saysF13Ib. , of which the city named Tarsus was the metropolis, the birth place of the Apostle Paul, Acts 22:3 . Hence the Mediterranean sea is called Tarshish, because the Cicilians were masters of it; and Tartessus in Spain might be a colony from them, as Broughton observes; and so Eusebius says, from the Tarsinns are the Iberians, or Spaniards; and which BochartF14Phaleg. l. 3. c. 7.  approves of, and confirms by various evidences; and Hillerus,F15Onomastic. Saer. p. 944.  makes Tarshish to be the author of the Celtae, that is, of the Spanish, French, and German nations. The third son of Javan is Kittim, whom JosephusF16Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.)  places in the island of Cyprus, a city there being called Citium, from whence was Zeno the Citian: but rather the people that sprung from him are those whom HomerF17Odyss. 11. ver. 520.  calls Cetii; and are placed by StraboF18Geograph. l. 13. p. 423.  to the west of Cilicia, in the western parts of which are two provinces, mentioned by PtolemyF19Ibid. l. 5. c. 8. , the one called Cetis, the other Citis: likewise this Kittim seems to be the father both of the Macedonians and the Latines; for Alexander the great is said to come from Cittim, and Perseus king of Macedon is called king of Cittim,&quot;And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten Darius king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the first over Greece,' (1 Maccabees 1:1)&quot;Beside this, how they had discomfited in battle Philip, and Perseus, king of the Citims, with others that lifted up themselves against them, and had overcome them:' (1 Maccabees 8:5)and Macedonia is sometimes called Macetia, as it is in GelliusF20Attic. Noct. l. 9. c. 3. , which has something of the name of Cittim or Cetim in it; and also the Latines or Romans seem to spring from hence, who may be thought to be meant by Cittim in Numbers 24:24   Daniel 11:30   and Eusebius says the Citians are a people from whom came the Sabines, who also are Romans; and in Latium was a city called Cetia, as says HalicarnassensisF21Hist. l. 8. p. 376. ; and BochartF23Phaleg. l. 3. c. 5. col. 159, 160.  has shown, that Latium and Cethem signify the same, and both have their names from words that signify to hide; &quot;latium a latendo&quot;, and &quot;celhem&quot;, from &#1499;&#1470;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; , &quot;to hide&quot;, see Jeremiah 2:22   in which sense the word is frequently used in the Arabic language; and Cittim in the Jerusalem Targum is here called Italy. The last son of Javan mentioned is Dodanim; he is omitted by Josephus: his country is by the Targum of Jonathan called Dordania; and by the Jerusalem Targum Dodonia; and he and his posterity are placed by Mr. Mede in part of Peloponnessus and Epirus, in which was the city of Dodona, where were the famous temple and oracle of Jupiter Dodonaeus, under which name this man was worshipped. In 1 Chronicles 1:7   he is called Rodanim, and in the Samaritan version here; and the word is by the Septuagint translated Rodians; which have led some to think of the island of Rhodes as the seat, and the inhabitants of it as the posterity of this man; but BochartF24Phaleg. l. 3. c. 6. col. 163, 164.  is of opinion, that they settled in the country now called France, gave the name to the river Rhodanus, and called the adjacent country Rhodanusia, and where formerly was a city of that name, much about the same tract where now stands Marseilles; but this seems too remote for a son of Javan. </p>

<p>By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands ,.... That is, by those sons of Japheth before mentioned; and by &quot;isles&quot; are meant, not countries surrounded with water, for the isles in this sense would not have been sufficient for the posterity of Japheth; nor can it be thought they would leave the continent, where there was room enough for them, and go into islands; and besides must have found it difficult to get there, when shipping and navigation were little known: but it is usual with the Hebrews, of whom Moses, the writer of this history, was, to call all places beyond the Mediterranean sea, or whatsoever they went to by sea, or that were upon the sea coasts, islands, as Greece, Italy, &c. Moreover, the word sometimes signifies countries, as it does in Job 22:30   and so should be rendered here, as it is by someF25&#1488;&#1497;&#1497;  &#1492;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;   &quot;regiones gentium&quot;, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Patrick. , &quot;the countries of the Gentiles&quot;; so called, because in the times of Moses, and at the writing of this history, those countries were inhabited by Heathens and idolaters, strangers to the true religion: and this division was not made at random, and at the pleasure of a rude company of men, but in an orderly regular manner, with the consent, and by the advice and direction of the principal men of those times; and especially it was directed by the wise providence of the most High, who divided to the nations their inheritance, and set the bounds of the people, Deuteronomy 32:8 . </p>
<p> everyone after his tongue, after their families, in their nations ; this shows, that what is said concerning the division of countries to the sons of Japheth is by way of anticipation; and that, though thus related, was not done till after the confusion of languages, since the partition was made according to the different languages of men; those that were of the same language went and dwelt together, the several nations of them, and the several families in those nations; by which it appears that this was done by consultation, with great care and wisdom, ranging the people according to their tongues; of which nations were formed, and with them were taken the several families they consisted of. </p>

<p>And the sons of Ham ,.... Next to the sons of Japheth, the sons of Ham are reckoned; these, JosephusF26Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect 1.)  says, possessed the land from Syria, and the mountains of Amanus and Lebanon; laying hold on whatever was towards the sea, claiming to themselves the countries unto the ocean, whose names, some of them, are entirely lost, and others so greatly changed and deflected into other tongues, that they can scarcely be known, and few whose names are preserved entire; and the same observation will hold good of others. Four of the sons of Ham are mentioned: </p>
<p> Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan ; the first of these, Cush, JosephusF1Ibid.  says, has suffered no loss by time; for the Ethiopians, whose prince he was, are to this day by themselves, and all in Asia, called Chusaeans: but though this word Cush, as used in Scripture, is generally rendered by us Ethiopia, this must not be understood of Ethiopia in Africa, but in Arabia; and indeed is always to be understood of one part of Arabia, and which was near to the land of Judea; so Moses's wife is called an Ethiopian, when she was an Arabian, or of Midian, Numbers 12:1   and Chusan and Midian are mentioned together, Habakkuk 3:7   see cf11ul 2Ki_19:9, cf11ul 2Ch_14:9 and BochartF2Phaleg. l. 4. c. 2.  has shown, by various arguments, that the land of Cush was Arabia; and so the Targum of Jonathan interprets it here Arabia. There was a city called Cutha in Erac, a province in the country of BabylonF3Vid. Hyde Hist. Relig. Pers. c. 2. p. 39, 40. , where Nimrod the son of Cush settled, which probably was called so from his father's name. Here the eastern writers sayF4Vid. Hyde Hist. Relig. Pers. c. 2. p. 72.  Abraham was born, and is the same place mentioned in 2 Kings 17:24 . The second son of Ham was Mizraim, the same with the Misor of SanchoniathoF5Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 1. p. 36. , and the Menes of HerodotusF6Enterpe sive, l. 2. c. 4. 99. , the first king of Egypt, and the builder of the city of Memphis in Egypt, called by the Turks to this day MitzirF7See Cumberland's Sanchoniatho, p. 59. . Mitzraim is a name by which Egypt is frequently called in Scripture, and this man was the father of the Egyptians; and because Egypt was inhabited by a son of Ham, it is sometimes called the land of Ham, Psalm 105:23 . The word is of the dual number, and serves to express Egypt by, which was divided into two parts, lower and upper Egypt. Josephus saysF8Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect 1.) , we call Egypt, Mestres, and all the Egyptians that inhabit it, Mestraeans; so the country is called by CedrenusF9Apud Grotium de vera Christ. Relig. l. 1. p. 8. & Ainsworth in loc. , Mestre; and Kairo, a principal city in it, is to this day by the Arabians called Al-messer, as Dr. ShawF11Travels, ch. 3. p. 294. Ed. 2.  relates. The third son of Ham is Phut; of whom JosephusF12Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect 1.)  says, that he founded Libya, calling the inhabitants of it after his name, Phuteans; and observes, that there is a river in the country of the Moors of his name; and that many of the Greek historians, who make mention of this river, also make mention of a country adjacent to it, called Phute: mention is made of this river as in Mauritania, both by PlinyF13Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 1.  and PtolemyF14Geograph. l. 4. c. 1, 3.  and by the latter of a city called Putea: this Phut is the Apollo Pythius of the Heathens, as some think. The last son of Ham is Canaan, the father of the Canaanites, a people well known in Scripture. Concerning these sons of Ham, there is a famous fragment of Eupolemus preserved in EusebiusF15Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 17. p. 419. ; and is this;&quot;the Babylonians say, that the first was Belus, called Cronus or Saturn (that is, Noah), and of him was begotten another Belus and Chanaan (it should be read Cham), and he (i.e. Ham) begat Chanaan, the father of the Phoenicians; and of him another son, Chus, was begotten, whom the Greeks call Asbolos, the father of the Ethiopians, and the brother of Mestraim, the father of the Egyptians.' </p>

<p>And the sons of Cush ,.... The first born of Ham, who had five sons, next mentioned, besides Nimrod, spoken of afterwards by himself: </p>
<p> Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha ; the first of these is Seba, the founder of the Sabaeans, according to JosephusF16Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.) , a people seated in Arabia Deserta, which seem to be the Sabaeans brought from the wilderness, Ezekiel 23:42   and very probably the same that plundered Job of his cattle, Job 1:14 . The second son is Havilah, who, as JosephusF17Ibid.  says, was the father of the Evilaeans, now called Getuli; but the posterity of Havilah seem to be the same whom StraboF18Geograph. l. 16. p. 528.  calls Chaulotaeans, and whom he speaks of along with the Nabataeans and Agraeans, a people near Arabia Felix; and by PlinyF19Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 11.  they are called Chavelaeans, and whom he speaks of as Arabians, and places them to the east of the Arabian Scenites. The third son is Sabtah; from him, JosephusF20Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.)  says, came the Sabathenes, who, by the Greeks, are called Astabari; the posterity of this man seemed to have settled in some part of Arabia Felix, since PtolemyF21Geograph. l. 6. c. 7.  makes mention of Sabbatha as the metropolis of that country, called by PlinyF23Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 28.  Sabotale, or rather Sabota, as it should be read; Ptolemy places another city in this country he calls Saphtha, which seems to have its name from this man. The fourth son is Raamah or Ragmas, as Josephus callsF24Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.)  him, from whom sprung the Ragmaeans he says; and most of the ancients call him Rhegmah, the letter &#1506;   being pronounced as a &quot;G&quot;, as in Gaza and Gomorrah: his posterity were also seated in Arabia Felix, near the Persian Gulf, where PtolemyF25Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 6. c. 7.)  places the city Rhegama, or as it is in the Greek text, Regma. The fifth son is Sabtecha, whom some make to be the father of a people in the same country, Arabia Felix, near the Persian Gulf, called Sachalitae; but Dr. WellsF26Geography of the Old Testament, vol. 1. p. 198.  thinks, that the descendants of this man might be from him regularly enough styled at first by the Greeks, Sabtaceni, which name might be afterwards softened into Saraceni, by which name it is well known the people of the northern parts of Arabia, where he places the descendants of this man, were formerly denominated; though BochartF1Phaleg l. 4. c. 4. col. 218.  carries them into Carmania in Persia, there being a short cut over the straits of the Persian Gulf, out of Arabia thither, where he finds a city called Samydace, and a river, Samydachus, which he thinks may come from Sabtecha, the letters &quot;B&quot; and &quot;M&quot; being frequently changed, as Berodach is called Merodach, and Abana, Amana, and so in other names. </p>
<p> And the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan ; no account is given of any of the posterity of the other sons of Cush, only of this his fourth son Raamah, who is said to have two sons; the first is called Sheba, from whom came the Sabaeans, according to JosephusF2Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.) ; not the Sabaeans before mentioned in Arabia Deserta, but those in Arabia Felix, where Pomponius MelaF3De Situ Orbis, l. 3. c. 8.  and StraboF4Geograph. l. 16. p. 536.  seat a people called Sabaeans, and whose country abounded with frankincense, myrrh, and cinnamon; the latter makes mention of a city of theirs called Mariaba, and seems to be the same that is now called Mareb, and formerly SabaF5Via. Pocock. Specimen Arab. Hist p. 57. , very likely from this man. The other son, Dedan, is called by JosephusF6Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 1.)  Judadas, whom he makes to be founder of the Judadaeans, a nation of the western Ethiopians; but the posterity of this man most probably settled in Arabia, and yet are to be distinguished from the Dedanim in Isaiah 21:13   who were Arabians also, but descended from Dedan the son of Jokshan, a son of Abraham by Keturah, Genesis 25:3   as well as from the inhabitants of Dedan in Edom, Jeremiah 25:23   it is observed, that near the city Regma before mentioned, on the same coast eastward, was another city called Dedan; and to this day Daden, from which the neighbouring country also takes its name, as BochartF7Phaleg. l. 4. c. 6. col. 219.  has observed, from Barboza, an Italian writer, in his description of the kingdom of Ormus: so that we need not doubt, says Dr. WellsF8Ut supra, (Geography of the Old Testament, vol. 1.) p. 197. , but that here was the settlement of Dedan the son of Raamah or Rhegma, and brother of Sheba. </p>

<p>And Cush begat Nimrod ,.... Besides the other five sons before mentioned; and probably this was his youngest son, being mentioned last; or however he is reserved to this place, because more was to be spoken of him than of any of the rest. Sir Walter RaleighF9History of the World, B. 1. ch. 10. sect. 1. p. 109.  thinks that Nimrod was begotten by Cush after his other children were become fathers, and of a later time than some of his grandchildren and nephews: and indeed the sons of Raamah, the fourth son of Cush, are taken notice of before him: however, the Arabic writersF11Elmacinus, p. 29. apud Hottinger. Smegma, p. 270. See the Universal History, vol. 1. p. 276.  must be wrong, who make him to be the son of Canaan, whereas it is so clear and express from hence that he was the son of Cush. In the Greek version he is called Nebrod, and by Josephus, Nebrodes, which is a name of Bacchus; and indeed Nimrod is the same with the Bacchus of the Heathens, for Bacchus is no other than Barchus, the son of Cush; and Jacchus, which is another of his names in Jah of Cush, or the god the son of Cush; and it is with respect to his original name Nebrod, or Nebrodes, that Bacchus is represented as clothed with the skin of    &#957;&#949;&#946;&#961;&#953;&#962; , &quot;nebris&quot;, or a young hind, as were also his priests; and so in his name Nimrod there may be an allusion to &#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; , &quot;Nimra&quot;, which, in the Chaldee language, signifies a tiger, and which kind of creatures, with others, he might hunt; tigers drew in the chariot of Bacchus, and he was sometimes clothed with the skin of one; though the name of Nimrod is usually derived from &#1502;&#1512;&#1491; , &quot;to rebel&quot;, because he was a rebel against God, as is generally said; and because, as Jarchi observes, he caused all the world to rebel against God, by the advice he gave to the generation of the division, or confusion of languages, the builders of Babel: he seems to be the same with Belus, the founder of Babel and of the Babylonian empire, whom Diodorus SiculusF12Bibliothec. l. 2. p. 90.  confounds with Ninus his son: </p>
<p> he began to be a mighty man in the earth : that is, he was the first that formed a plan of government, and brought men into subjection to it; and so the JewsF13Pirke Eliezer, c. 11.  make him to be the first king after God; for of the ten kings they speak of in the world, God is the first, and Nimrod the second; and so the Arabic writersF14Elmacinus, p. 29. Patricides, p. 16. apud Hottinger. Smegma, p. 271,272. Abulpharag. Hist. Dynast. p. 18.  say, he was the first of the kings that were in the land of Babylon; and that, seeing the figure of a crown in the heaven, he got a golden one made like it, and put it on his head; hence it was commonly reported, that the crown descended to him from heaven; for this refers not to his gigantic stature, as if he was a giant, as the Septuagint render it; or a strong robust man, as Onkelos; nor to his moral character, as the Targum of Jonathan, which is,&quot;he began to be mighty in sin, and to rebel before the Lord in the earth;'but to his civil character, as a ruler and governor: he was the first that reduced bodies of people and various cities into one form of government, and became the head of them; either by force and usurpation, or it may be with the consent of the people, through his persuasion of them, and on account of the mighty and heroic actions done by him. </p>

<p>He was a mighty hunter before the Lord ,.... Which might be literally true; for, from the time of the flood to his days, wild beasts might increase very much, and greatly annoy men who dwelt very likely for the most part in tents scattered up and down in divers places: so that he did a good office in hunting and destroying them. An Arabic writerF15Abulpharag. Hist. Dynast. p. 18. , of some authority in the eastern parts, says, that by hunting he got food sufficient for the builders of Babel, while they were employed therein; and Aben Ezra interprets it in his favour, that he built altars, and the creatures he took in hunting he offered them on them a burnt offering to God. But neither of these is probable; however, it may be observed, that in this way by hunting he arrived to the power and dominion over men he afterwards had; for not only he ingratiated himself into their favour by hunting down and destroying the wild beasts which molested them, but by these means he might gather together a large number of young men, strong and robust, to join him in hunting; whereby they were inured to hardships, and trained up to military exercises, and were taught the way of destroying men as well as beasts; and by whose help and assistance he might arrive to the government he had over men; and hunting, according to AristotleF16Politic. l. 1. c. 8. , is a part of the military art, which is to be used both on beasts, and on such men who are made to be ruled, but are not willing; and it appears, from XenophonF17Cyropaed. l. 1. c. 5. , that the kings of Persia were fitted for war and government by hunting, and which is still reckoned in many countries a part of royal education. And it may be remarked, that, as Nimrod and Bacchus are the same, as before observed, one of the titles of Bacchus is    &#950;&#945;&#947;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#962; , &quot;an hunter&quot;. CedrenusF18Apud Abrami Pharum, l. 5. sect. 6. p. 128.  says, that the Assyrians deified Nebrod, or Nimrod, and placed him among the constellations of heaven, and called him Orion; the same first discovered the art of hunting, therefore they joined to Orion the star called the dog star. However, besides his being in a literal sense an hunter, he was in a figurative sense one, a tyrannical ruler and governor of men. The Targum of Jonathan is;&quot;he was a powerful rebel before the Lord;'and that of Jerusalem,&quot;he was powerful in hunting in sin before the Lord,'and another Jewish writerF19R. Gedaliah, Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 76. 2.  says, he was called a mighty hunter, because he was all his days taking provinces by force, and spoiling others of their substance; and that he was &quot;before the Lord&quot;, truly so, and he seeing and taking notice of it, openly and publicly, and without fear of him, and in a bold and impudent manner, in despite of him, see Genesis 6:11 . The Septuagint render it, &quot;against the Lord&quot;; he intended, as Jarchi's note is, to provoke him to his face: </p>
<p> wherefore it is said ; in a proverbial way, when any man is grown mighty and powerful, or is notoriously wicked, or is become a tyrant and an oppressor of the people, that he is </p>
<p> even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord . This was a proverb used in the times of Moses, as it is common now with us to call a hunter Nimrod. </p>

<p>And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel ,.... The city of Babel, or Babylon, which was built by his direction; for though Babylon is by some writers said to be built by Semiramis, the wife of Ninus, and others by Ninus himself, yet the truest account is, that it was built by Belus, the same with Nimrod. CurtiusF20Hist. l. 5. c. 1.  says, Semiramis built it; or, as most believe, adds he, Belus, whose royal palace is shown: and BerosusF21Apud Joseph. contra Apion. l. 1. c. 20. , the Chaldean, blames the Greek writers for ascribing it to Semiramis; and AbydenusF23Apud. Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 9. c. 41. p. 457. , out of Megasthenes, affirms, that Belus surrounded Babylon with a wall: however, this was the head of the kingdom of Nimrod, as Onkelos renders it, or his chief city, or where he first began to reign. Here he set up his kingdom, which he enlarged and extended afterwards to other places; and from hence it appears, that what is related in this context, concerning Nimrod, is by way of anticipation; for it was not a fact that he was a mighty man, or a powerful prince possessed of a kingdom, until after the building of Babel, and the confusion of languages there; when those that continued on the spot either chose him for their ruler, or he, by power or policy, got the dominion over them. ArtapanusF24Apud. Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 9. c. 18. p. 420. , an Heathen writer, relates, that the giants which inhabited Babylon being taken away by the gods for their impiety, one of them, Belus, escaped death and dwelt in Babylon, and took up his abode in the tower which he had raised up, and which, from him the founder of it, was called Belus; so that this, as Moses says, was the beginning of his kingdom, together with </p>
<p> Erech, and Accad, and Calneh in the land of Shinar , where the city and tower of Babel were built: for of these four cities, which were all in the same country, did the kingdom of Nimrod consist; they all, either by force or by consent, were brought into subjection to him, and were under one form of government, and is the first kingdom known to be set up in the world. Erech, according to the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem, is Hades, or Edessa, a city in Mesopotamia; but it is rather thought to be the name with the Aracca of PtolemyF25Geograph. l. 6. c. 3. , and the Arecha of MarcellinusF26Lib. 23. , placed by them both in Susiana; though one would think it should be that city in Chaldea which took its present Arabic name of Erak from Erech: the Arabic writers sayF1Vid. Hyde in notis ad Peritsol. Itinera Mundi, p. 65. , when Irac or Erac is absolutely put, it denotes Babylonia, or Chaldea, in the land of Shinar; and they say that Shinar is in Al-Erac. The next city, Accad, according to the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem, is Netzibin, or Nisibis, a city in Mesopotamia; in the Septuagint version it is called Archad; and CtesiasF2Apud Aelian. Hist. Animal. l. 16. c. 42.  relates, that at the Persian Sittace was a river called Argad, which BochartF3Phaleg. l. 4. c. 17.  thinks carries in it a manifest trace of this name; and observes, from StraboF4Geograph. l. 15. p. 503. , that that part of Babylon nearest to Susa was called Sitacena. And the other city, Calneh, according to the above Targums, is Ctesiphon, and is generally thought to be the place intended, and was a town upon the Tigris, near to Seleucia in Babylon; it was first called Chalone, and its name was changed to Ctesiphon by Pacorus, king of the Persians. It is in Isaiah 10:9   called Calno, and by the Septuagint version there the Chalane, which adds,&quot;where the tower was built;'and from whence the country called the Chalonitis by PlinyF5Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 26.  had its name, the chief city of which was Ctesiphon; and who saysF6Ibid. c. 27.  Chalonitis is joined with Ctesiphon. Thus far goes the account of Nimrod; and, though no mention is made of his death, yet some writers are not silent about it. AbulpharagiusF7Hist. Dynast. p. 12. , an Arabic writer, says he died in the tower of Babel, it being blown down by stormy winds; the Jewish writers sayF8In Pirke Eliezer, c. 24.  he was killed by Esau for the sake of his coat, which was Adam's, and came to Noah, and from him to Ham, and so to Nimrod. When he began his reign, and how long he reigned, is not certain; we have only some fabulous accounts: according to BerosusF9Antiqu. l. 4. p. 28, 29. , he began to reign one hundred and thirty one years after the flood, and reigned fifty six years, and then disappeared, being translated by the gods: and, indeed, the authors of the Universal History place the beginning of his reign in the year of the flood one hundred and thirty one, and thirty years after the dispersion at BabylonF11Vol. 1. p. 282. and vol. 21. p. 2. ; and who relate, that the eastern writers speak of his reign as very long: a Persian writer gives his name a Persian derivation, as if it was Nemurd, that is, &quot;immortal&quot;, on account of his long reign of above one hundred and fifty years: and some of the Mahometan historians say he reigned in Al-Sowad, that is, the &quot;black country&quot;, four hundred yearsF12Apud Hyde's Hist.

<p>Out of that land went forth Ashur ,.... It is a question whether Ashur is the name of a man or of a country; some take it in the latter sense, and render the words, &quot;and out of that land he went forth into Assyria&quot;; so Onkelos; and in this way go Junius and Tremellius, Piscator, Bochart, Cocceius, and others, and the margin of our Bible, and interpret it of Nimrod; and the Targum of Jonathan is express for him, which is this:&quot;out of that land went forth Nimrod, and reigned in Assyria, because he would not be in the council of the generation of the division, and he left four cities; and the Lord gave him therefore a place (or Assyria), and he built four other cities, Nineveh, &c.'so Theophilus of Antioch saysF13Ad Autolycum, l. 2. p. 106. , that Nebroth (Nimrod) built the same; but then the generality of interpreters which take this way give another and better reason for Nimrod's going out of Shinar or Babylon into Assyria than the Targumist gives; which is, that not content with his own dominions, and willing to enlarge them, he went out and made war upon Assyria, and seized upon it, and built cities in it, and added them to his former ones; in favour of this sense it is urged, that Moses is speaking of what Nimrod the son of Cush did, of the line of Ham, and not of the sons of Shem, among whom Ashur was; and that it is not probable he should introduce a passage relating to a branch of Shem, when he is professedly writing about that of Ham; nor is it agreeable to the history to speak of what Ashur did, before any mention of his birth, which is in Genesis 10:22   nor was it peculiar to him to go out of the land of Shinar, since almost all were dispersed from thence; add to which, that Assyria is called the land of Nimrod, Micah 5:6   to which it may be replied, that parentheses of this sort are frequent in Scripture, see 2 Samuel 4:4   besides, it seems appropriate enough, when treating of Nimrod's dominion and power, in order to show his intolerable tyranny, to remark, that it was such, that Ashur, a son of Shem, could not bear it, and therefore went out from a country he had a right unto; and as for the text in Micah 5:6   the land of Nimrod and the land of Assyria are manifestly distinguished from one another: add to this, that, if Nimrod so early made a conquest of Assyria, it would rather have been called by his own name than his uncle's; and it is allowed by all that the country of Assyria had its name from Ashur, the son of Shem; and who so likely to have founded Nineveh, and other cities, as himself? Besides these, interpreters are obliged to force the text, and insert the particle &quot;into&quot;, which is not in it; and the order and construction of the words are more natural and agreeable to the original, as in our version and others, which make Ashur the name of a man, than this, which makes it a country: but then it is not agreed on who this Ashur was; some will have him to be of the posterity of Ham, and a son of Nimrod, as EpiphaniusF14Contra Haeres. l. 1. p. 3.  and ChrysostomF15In Genes. Homil. 29. ; but this is not probable, nor can any proof be given of it; JosephusF16Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 4.  is express for it, that Ashur, the son of Shem, built Nineveh, and gave the name of Assyrians to those that were subject to him. The reason of his going out from Shinar, as given by Jarchi, is, when he saw his sons hearkening to Nimrod, and rebelling against the Lord, by building a tower, he went out from them; or it may be, he was drove out by Nimrod by force, or he could not bear his tyrannical government, or live where such a wicked man ruled: and as Nimrod built cities and set up an empire, Ashur did the same in his own defence and that of his posterity: </p>
<p> and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah . The first of these cities, Nineveh, the Greeks commonly call Ninus, is placed by StraboF17Geograph. l. 16. p. 507.  in Atyria, the Chaldee name of Assyria, who generally suppose it had its name from Ninus, whom Diodorus SiculusF18Bibliothec. l. 2. p. 90, 91.  makes the first king of the Assyrians, and to whom he ascribes the building of this city; and who, one would think, should be Ashur, and that Ninus was another name of him, or however by which he went among the Greeks; and so this city was called after him; or rather it had its name from the beauty of it, the word signifying a beautiful habitation, as CocceiusF19In Jonam, 1, 2.  and HillerusF20Onomast. Sacr. p. 304, 431.  give the etymology of it; or perhaps, when it was first built by him, it had another name, but afterwards was called Nineveh, from Ninus, who lived many years after him, who might repair, adorn, and beautify it. It was destroyed by the Medes and Babylonians, as foretold by Nahum, and it is difficult now to say where it stood; the place where it is supposed to have been is now called Mosul; of which place RauwolffF21Travels, part 2. c. 9. p. 166.  says, who was there in 1574, that&quot;there are some very good buildings and streets in it, and it is pretty large, but very ill provided with walls and ditches;--besides this, I also saw, (says he,) just without the town, a little hill, that was almost quite dug through, and inhabited by poor people, where I saw them several times creep in and out as pismires in ant hills: in this place, or thereabouts, stood formerly the potent town of Nineveh, built by Ashur, which was the metropolis of Assyria;--at this time there is nothing of antiquities to be seen in it, save only the fort that lieth upon the hill, and some few villages, which the inhabitants say did also belong to it in former days. This town lieth on the confines of Armenia, in a large plain:'See Gill on Jonah 1:2 , Jonah 3:1 , Jonah 3:2 , Jonah 3:3 , Nahum 1:8   The next city, Rehoboth, signifies &quot;streets&quot;, and so it is rendered in the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem; and, because in the Chaldee language streets are called &quot;Beritha&quot;, BochartF23Phaleg. l. 4. c. 21. col. 256.  thinks that this Rehoboth is the city which PtolemyF24Geograph. l. 5. c. 19.  calls Birtha, on the west of Tigris, at the mouth of the river Lycus, though he places it by Euphrates; wherefore it should rather be Oroba, he places at the river TigrisF25Ibid. l. 6. c. 1. , near to Nineveh also. The last city, Calah, or Calach, was a principal city in the country, by PtolemyF26Ibid.  called Calacine, and by StraboF1Geograph. l. 11. p. 347, 365. & l. 16. p. 507.  Calachene, and mentioned by both along with Adiabene, a country in Assyria. </p>

<p>And Resen, between Nineveh and Calah ,.... This was another city built by Ashur, situated between those two cities mentioned: the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem call it Talsar, or Thalassar, see Isaiah 37:12   The conjecture of BochartF2Phaleg. l. 4. c. 23.  is more probable, that it is the Larissa of Xenophon, situated on the Tigris; though Junius thinks it is either Bassora, or Belcina, which PtolemyF3Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 5. c. 19.)  places on the Tigris, near Nineveh: </p>
<p> the same is a great city : which Jarchi interprets of Nineveh, called a great city, and was indeed one, being sixty miles in circumference, Jonah 1:2   but the construction of the words carries it to Resen, which might be the greatest city when first built; and, if understood of Larissa, was a great city, the walls of it being one hundred feet high, and the breadth twenty five, and the compass of it eight miles. Benjamin of Tudela saysF4Itinerarium, p. 75. , that in his time Resen was called Gehidagan, and was a great city, in which were 5000 Israelites; but according to Schmidt, this refers to all the cities in a coalition, Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen, which all made that great city Nineveh; or were a Tetrapolis, as Tripoli was anciently three cities, built by the joint interest of the Aradians, Sidonians, and Tyrians, as Diodorus SiculusF5Bibliothec. l. 16. p. 439.  relates. </p>

<p>And Mizraim begat Ludim ,.... Mizraim was the second son of Ham, of whom See Gill on Genesis 10:6 . Ludim he is said to beget, the word being plural, is not the name of a man, but of his posterity; and the sense is, that Mizraim begat the father of the Ludim, whose name very probably was Lud, which name is preserved in Isaiah 66:19 . These Ludim are the same with the Lydians, Jeremiah 46:9   and whose country is called Lydia, Ezekiel 30:5   but to be distinguished from Lydia in Asia Minor, and the Lydians there who sprung from Lud, a son of Shem, Genesis 10:22   for, as these sprung from Mizraim, the founder of Egypt, they must be somewhere thereabout; and BochartF6Phaleg. l. 4. c. 26.  has proved, by various arguments, that they are the Ethiopians in Africa, now called Abyssines, whose country lies to the south of Egypt, a people formerly famous for archery, as Lud and the Lydians are said to be, Isaiah 66:19   and whoever reads the accounts Diodorus SiculusF7Bibliothec. l. 2. p. 143, &c.  gives of the Egyptians and Ethiopians, will easily discern a likeness between them, and that the one sprung from the other; both deifying their kings; showing a like carefulness about their funerals; both using hieroglyphics; having the like order of priests, who used shaving; and circumcision was common to them both, as Herodotus observesF8Euterpe sive, l. 2. c. 104. : </p>
<p> and Ananzim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim : the name of the father of the Anamim very probably was Anam, though we have no account of him elsewhere: according to HillerusF9Onomastic. Sacr. p. 283. , the Anamim were called so from the pastoral life they led; and, by a transposition of letters, were the same with the Maeonians, who inhabited that tract of land in Asia which was washed by the river Maeonia, or Maeander, and bordered on Lydia; but, as these were the descendants of Mizraim, they must be sought for somewhere about Egypt: much better therefore does Mr. BroughtonF11See his Works, p. 4, 60.  take them to be the Nubians and Numidians, which were near both Egypt and Ethiopia; though BochartF12Phaleg. l. 4. c. 30. col. 284.  seems to be most correct, in making them to be the Ammonians, who, Herodotus says, were a colony of the Egyptians and Ethiopians; these lived about Ammon and Nasamonitis, and in that part of Lybia in which the temple of Jupiter Ammon stood, and are the Nomades, that lived a pastoral life; and BochartF13Ib. c. 42.  thinks they are called Anamim, from Anam, which, in the Arabic language, signifies a &quot;sheep&quot;, because they fed sheep, and lived upon them, and clothed themselves with their skins. The word Lehabim, the name of another people from Mizraim, signifies &quot;flames&quot;; and were so called, as Jarchi observes, because their faces were like flames, see Isaiah 13:8   burnt with the heat of the sun, living near the torrid zone; and therefore could not be the Lycians, as HillerusF14Onomastic. Sacr. p. 281, 583.  thinks, the inhabitants of a country in Asia, between Caria and Pamphylia, formerly called Lycia, now Aidimelli, which he observes abounds with places that have their names from fire and flames, as Mount Chimaera, the cities Hephaestium, Myra, Lemyra, Habessus, Telmessus, Balbura, and Sirbis; but these were too far from Egypt, near which it is more probable the Lehabim were, and seem to be the same with the Lubim, which came with Shishak out of Egypt to invade Judea, 2 Chronicles 12:3   and who were called Lybians, Jeremiah 46:9   and their country Lybia, Ezekiel 30:5   of which Leo AfricanusF1Descriptio Africae, l. 1. p. 74.  says, that it is a desert, dry and sandy, having neither fountains nor springs; which was near Egypt as well as Ethiopia, with which it is joined in the above place, see Acts 2:10 . The word Naphtuhim, the name of another people that sprung from Mizraim, according to HillerusF15Onomastic Sacr. p. 161, 178, 283, 421. , signifies &quot;open&quot;; and he thinks they are the Pamphylians, who used to admit promiscuously all into their ports and towns, which were open to all strangers, and even robbers, for the sake of commerce; but, as these were a people in lesser Asia, they cannot be the people here meant. BochartF16Phaleg. l. 4. c. 26.  observes, from Plutarch, that the Egyptians used to call the extreme parts of a country, and abrupt places and mountains adjoining to the sea, Nepthys, the same with Nephthuah; and therefore he is of opinion, that these Naphtuhim dwelt on the shores of the Mediterranean sea, near Egypt, in Marmorica; not far from whence was the temple of Aptuchus, mentioned by PtolemyF17Geograph. l. 4. c. 4. , and placed by him in Cyrene, which carries in it some trace of the name of Naphtuhim; and he suspects that Neptune had his name from hence; he being a Lybian god, as HerodotusF18Herodot. Thalia, sive, l. 3. c. 21. Euterpe sive, l. 2. c. 50.  says; for none ever used his name before the Lybians, who always honoured him as a god: and it may be observed, from StraboF19Geograph, l. 8. p. 237. , that many of the temples of Neptune were on the sea shore. Some place these people about Memphis, the name of which was Noph, Isaiah 19:13   but perhaps it may be much better to place them in the country of Nepate, between Syene and Meroc, where Candace, queen of Ethiopia, had her royal palace in the times of StraboF20Geograph. l. 17. p. 564. . </p>

<p>And Pathrusim ,.... These are other descendants of Mizraim, the name of whose father very probably was Pathros, from whom the country of Pathros was called, and which is not only spoken of in Scripture along with Egypt, but as a part of it, Isaiah 11:11   and these Pathrusim were doubtless the inhabitants of it; which, as BochartF21Phaleg. l. 4. c. 31.  has shown, is no other than Thebais, or the upper Egypt. HillerusF23Onomastic. Sacr. p. 161, 585.  takes the word to be compounded of &#1508;&#1488;&#1514;   and &#1512;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; , and renders it the corner of the Rosians, and makes it to be the same with the bay of Issus, where was a colony of Egypt, called Cilicians; but the former is more probable. </p>
<p> And Casluhim ; these also were the posterity of Mizraim, by another son of his, from whence they had their name: according to HillerusF24Ibid. p. 161, 583, 777. , they are the Solymi, a people near the Lycians and Pisidians, that came out of Egypt, and settled in those parts; but it is much more likely that they were, as JuniusF25In loc.  observes, the inhabitants of Casiotis, a country mentioned by PtolemyF26Geograph. l. 4. c. 5.  in lower Egypt, at the entrance of it, where stood Mount Casius: but BochartF1Phaleg. l. 4. c. 31.  is of opinion that they are the Colchi, the inhabitants of the country now called Mingrelia, and which, though at a distance from Egypt, the ancient inhabitants came from thence, as appears from several ancient authors of good credit, as the above learned writer shows. </p>
<p> Out of whom came Philistim , or the Philistines, a people often spoken of in Scripture: these sprung from the Casluhim, or were a branch of that people; according to Ben Melech they sprung both from them and from the Pathrusim; for Jarchi says they changed wives with one another, and so the Philistines sprung from them both; or these were a colony that departed from them, and settled elsewhere, as the Philistines did in the land of Canaan, from whence that part of it which they inhabited was called Palestine: and, if the Casluhim dwelt in Casiotis, at the entrance of Egypt, as before observed, they lay near the land of Canaan, and could easily pass into it.

<p> and Caphtorim , and read the whole verse thus: &quot;and Pathrusim, and Casluhim, and Caphtorim, out of whom came Philistim&quot;; that is, they came out of the Caphtorim. What has led to such a transposition of the words in the text is Amos 9:7   &quot;and the Philistines from Caphtor&quot;: but though they are said to he brought from a place called Caphtor, yet did not spring from the Caphtorim: to me it rather seems, that the two latter were brothers, and both sprung from the Casluhim; since the words may be rendered without a parenthesis: &quot;and Caluhim, out of whom came Philistim and Caphtorim&quot;; though perhaps it may be best of all to consider the two last as the same, and the words may be read, &quot;out of whom came Philistim, even&quot;, or that is, &quot;the Caphtorim&quot;; for the Philistines, in the times of Jeremiah, are said to be the remnant of the country of Caphtor, Jeremiah 47:4   and as in Amos the Philistines are said to come out of Caphtor, in Deuteronomy 2:23   they are called Caphtorim, that came out of Caphtor, who destroyed the Avim, which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, or Gaza, afterwards a principal city of the Philistines: for then, and not before their settlement in the land of Canaan, were they so called; for the word Philistim signifies strangers, people of another country; and the Septuagint version always so renders the word: their true original name seems to be Caphtorim. BochartF2Phaleg. l. 4. c. 32.  indeed will have the Caphtorim to be the Cappadocians, that dwelt near Colchis, about Trapezunt, where he finds a place called Side, which in Greek signifies a pomegranate, as Caphtor does in Hebrew; and so HillerusF3Onamastic. Sacr. p. 160, 282.  takes it for a name of the Cappadocians, who inhabited &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;  &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;   &quot;Cappath Hor&quot;, or the side of Mount Hor, or &#1499;&#1507;  &#1492;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512; , the side of Mount Taurus; and in this they both follow the Jewish Targumists, who everywhere render Caphtorim by Cappadocians, as the three Targums do here, and Caphtor by Cappadocia, and as Jonathan on Deuteronomy 2:23   but then thereby they understood a people and place in Egypt, even Damietta, the same they suppose with Pelusium; for other Jewish writers sayF4Maimon. & Bartenora in Misn. Cetubot, c. 13, p. 11. , Caphutkia, or Cappadocia, is Caphtor, and in the Arabic language Damietta: so Benjamin of Tudela saysF5ltinerarium, p. 125. , in two days I came to Damietta, this is Caphtor; and it seems pretty plain that Caphtor must be some place in Egypt, as Coptus, or some other, and that the Caphtorim, or Philistines, were originally Egyptians, since they descended from Mizraim. </p>

<p>And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn ,.... Canaan is the fourth son of Ham; the posterity of Phut, his third son, are omitted: the firstborn of Canaan was Sidon, from whom the city of Sidon had its name, being either built by himself, who called it after his own name, or by some of his posterity, who called it so in memory of their ancestor: it was a very ancient city, more ancient than Tyre, for that was built by the Sidonians; Homer makes mention of it, but not of Tyre: it is now called Said, as it was in the times of Benjamin of TudelaF6Itinerarium. p. 34. . JustinF7E. Trogo, l. 18. c. 3.  says it had its name from the plenty of fish on its coasts; but, since Canaan had a son of this name, it was no doubt so called from him. </p>

<p>And the Jebusite ,.... Who had their name from Jebus, a third son of Canaan, and from whom Jerusalem was called Jebus, Judges 19:10   and where his posterity continued to dwell when the land of Canaan was possessed by the Israelites; for they were so strong and powerful, that the men of Judah could not drive them out from thence, and here they remained until the times of David, who dispossessed them of it, Joshua 15:63 . There is an island near Spain, formerly called Ebusus, now Ibissa, where was one of the colonies of the Phoenicians, in which, BochartF7Phaleg. l. 4. c. 36. fol. 304.  observes, the name of the Jebusites is thought to remain. </p>
<p> And the Emorite ; so called from Emor, the fourth son of Canaan, commonly called the Amorite, a people so strong and mighty, that they are compared to cedars for height, and to oaks for strength, Amos 2:9   they dwelt both on this and the other side Jordan: Sihon, one of their kings, made war on the king of Moab, and took all his country from him unto Arnon, Numbers 21:26   and in the times of Joshua there were several kings of the Amorites, which dwelt on the side of Jordan westward, Joshua 5:1   hence it may be Amor, in the Arabic tongue signifying to command, and Emir, a commander. </p>
<p> And the Girgasite ; the same with the Gergesene in Matthew 8:28   who, in the times of Christ, lived about Gerasa, or Gadara: a Jewish writerF8R. Zacuth. Sepher.

<p>And the Hivite ,.... These dwelt in Hermon, a part of Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath, Joshua 11:3   to the east of the land of Canaan; hence they were sometimes called Kadmonites, or Easterlings, Genesis 15:19   and are thought to have their name from dwelling in holes and caves like serpents; hence Cadmus the Phoenician, and his wife Hermonia, who seem to have their names from hence, are reported to be turned into serpents, they being Hivites, which this word signifies, as BochartF9Ut supra.

<p>And the Arvadite ,.... The inhabitants of Arvad, or Aradus, an island in the Phoenician sea; it is mentioned with Sidon, Ezekiel 27:8   so Josephus saysF17Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 2. , the Arudaeans possessed the island Aradus: it is about a league distant from the shore; StraboF18Geograph. l. 16. p. 518.  says it is twenty furlongs from land, and about seven in circumference, and is said to be built by the Sidonians; it is now, as Mr. MaundrelF19Journey from Aleppo, &c. p. 19. Ed. 7.  says, by the Turks called Ru-ad, or, as Dr. Shaw saysF20Travels, p. 267. Ed. 2. , Rou-wadde; See Gill on Ezekiel 27:8 . </p>
<p> And the Zemarite ; who perhaps built and inhabited Simyra, a place mentioned by PlinyF21Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 20. , not far from Lebanon, and along with Marathos, and Antarados, which lay on the continent, right against the island Aradus, or Arvad, and near the country of the Aradians. StraboF23Geograph. l. 16. p. 518.  makes mention of a place called Taxymira, which Casaubon observes should be Ximyra, or Simyra; and MelaF24De situ orbis, l. 1. c. 12.  speaks of the castle of Simyra as in Phoenicia. There was a city called Zemaraim in the tribe of Benjamin, Joshua 18:22   which Bishop Patrick suggests, and Ainsworth before him, that Zemarus, the son of Canaan, might be the founder of; and there is also a mountain of the same name in Mount Ephraim, 2 Chronicles 13:4 . </p>
<p> And the Hamathite : who dwelt in Amathine, as JosephusF25Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 2.) , and was in his time called by the inhabitants Amathe; but the Macedonians called it, from one of their race, Epiphania, which seems to have been the country called Amathite,He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country. (1 Maccabees 12:25)there was another Hamath, called Antiochia, but cannot be meant, since Hamath was the northern border of the land of Israel, then called the entrance of Hamath, which border was pretty near to Epiphania, but not so far as Antioch; this is the Amathus of Syria, twice mentioned by Herodotus, as HillerusF26Onomastic. Sacr. p. 780.  observes: but both RelandF1Palestina Illustrata, tom. 1. l. 1. p. 121, 123, 317.  and VitringaF2Comment. in Jesaiam, c. 10, 9.  are of opinion, that the Hamath so often mentioned in Scripture, which doubtless had its name from the Hamathite, is neither Antiochia nor Epiphania, but the city Emesa, or Emissa, which lay below Epiphania, upon the Orontes, nearer Damascus and the land of Canaan; and Hamath is mentioned with Damascus and Arpad, or Arvad, Isaiah 10:9   and, according to Ezekiel 47:16 . Hamath must lie between Damascus and the Mediterranean sea. </p>
<p> And afterwards were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad ; not only these eleven, but two more which are not mentioned, the Canaanites properly so called, and the Perizzites; these families at first dwelt in one place, or within narrow limits; but, as they increased, they spread themselves further every way, and in process of time possessed all the country from Idumea and Palestine to the mouth of the Orontes, and which they held about seven hundred years, when five of these families, with the two other above mentioned, were cast out of the land for their sins, and to make way for the people of Israel. </p>

<p>And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon ,.... This is to be understood, not of the Canaanites, properly so called, but of them in general; and is a description of the bounds of the land of Canaan, as possessed by the people of Israel: the northern or north west border of it was Sidon, see Genesis 10:15   and is to be understood of the country which reached from that city towards the east almost as far as Jordan: </p>
<p> as thou comest from Gerar unto Gaza ; two cities of the Philistines, well known in Scripture, the former for being the place where Abraham and Isaac sometimes sojourned, and the latter for Samson's exploits in it; these were the southern or south west border of the land of Canaan: </p>
<p> as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah and Zeboim ; four cities destroyed by fire from heaven, as is after related in this book; these lay to the south or south east part of the land: </p>
<p> even unto Lashah ; which, according to the Targum of Jonathan, is Callirrhoe, a place famous for hot waters, which run into the Dead sea, and who in this is followed by Jerom; but since it was not in the southern part of Judea, as Lashah was, Bochart proposesF1Phaleg. l. 4. c. 37. col. 309.  Lusa, as being more likely to be the place, a city of the Arabs, which PtolemyF2Geograph. l. 5. c. 17.  puts in the midway between the Mediterranean and the Red sea; but this is objected to by RelandF3Palestina Illustrata, tom. 2. p. 871. , since the southern borders of the land of Canaan were from the extremity of the Dead sea unto the Mediterranean sea, from which Lusa was at a great distance: the Samaritan version of this verse is very different from the Hebrew, and is this,&quot;and the border of the Canaanites was from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates, and unto the hinder sea:'i.e. the western or Mediterranean. </p>

<p>Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber ,.... And for the sake of those Shem is particularly said to be the father of, is this genealogy given, and indeed the whole book of Genesis wrote: Eber was the great-grandson of Shem, and is here spoken of by anticipation, and Shem is called not the father of either of his immediate sons, but of the posterity of this man; because the Hebrews sprung from him in his line, among whom the church of God and the true religion were preserved, and from whom the Messiah was to come, as he did: the word Eber, Jarchi interprets, &quot;beyond the river, Euphrates&quot; or &quot;Tigris&quot;, or both, as describing the seat of the posterity of Shem; but as this too much straitens them, since they inhabited on both sides, Dr. HydeF4Hist. Relig. Pers. c. 2. p. 47, 48.  has shown that the word used may refer to both, to those beyond these rivers, and to those on this side; see Numbers 24:24 . </p>
<p> the brother of Japheth the elder ; he was the brother of Ham too, but he is not mentioned because of the behaviour towards his father, and because of the curse that was upon him and his; but Shem's relation to Japheth is expressed to show that they were alike in their disposition; and it may be to signify, that in times to come their posterity would unite in spiritual things, which has been fulfilled already in part, and will be more fully by the coalition of the Jews, the posterity of Shem, and of the Gentiles, the posterity of Japheth, in the Christian church state: and from hence we learn that Japheth was the eldest of Noah's sons, though some render the words, &quot;the elder brother of Japheth&quot;F5&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;  &#1497;&#1508;&#1514;  &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;   &quot;fratre Japheth majore&quot;. V. L. Samar. Syr. Ar. &quot;frater major natu ipsius Japheth&quot;, Tigurine version; &quot;fratri Japheti majori&quot;, Cocceius; so some in Vatablus. ; and so make Shem to be the eldest; but as this is contrary to the accents, so to the history: for Noah was five hundred years old when he began to beget sons, Genesis 5:32   he was six hundred when he went into the ark, Genesis 7:11   two years after the flood Shem begat Arphaxad, when he was one hundred years old, and Noah six hundred and two, Genesis 11:10   so that Shem must be born when Noah was five hundred and two years old; and since he begot children, there must be one two years older than Shem, which can be no other than Japheth, since Ham is called his younger son, Genesis 9:24 . </p>

<p>The children of Shem ,.... Whose names are </p>
<p> Elam and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram ; and who, as JosephusF6Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 4.  says, inhabited Asia, from Euphrates to the Indian ocean: his first born, Elam, was the father of the Elymaeans, from whom sprung the Persians, as the same writer observes, and his posterity are called Elamites, Acts 2:10   their country Elam, and is sometimes mentioned with Media, when the Persians and Medes are intended, Isaiah 21:2   see also Isaiah 22:6 , &c. in Daniel's time, Shushan, in the province of Elam, was the seat of the kings of Persia: the country of Elymais, so called from this man, is said by PlinyF7Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 27.  to be divided from Susiane by the river Eulaeus, and to join with Persia; and the famous city of Elymais, the metropolis of the country, is placed by JosephusF8Antiqu. l. 12. c. 8. sect. 1.  in Persia. Ashur, the second son of Shem, gives name to Assyria, a country frequently mentioned in Scripture; and which, according to PtolemyF9Geograph. l. 6. c. 1. , was bounded on the north by part of Armenia the great, and the mountain Niphates, on the west by Mesopotamia and the river Tigris, on the south by Susiane, and on the east by part of Media. Strabo saysF11Ib. l. 16. p. 507.  they call Babylonia, and great part of the country about it, Assyria, in which was Ninus or Nineveh, the chief city of the Assyrian empire; and which was built by Ashur, as JosephusF12Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 4.  affirms, and says he gave the name of Assyrians to his subjects: Arphaxad, the third son of Shem, from him that part of Assyria, which lay northward next to Armenia, was called Arphaxitis, as it is probable that was its original name, though corruptly called by PtolemyF13Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 6. c. 1.)  Arrapachitis: Josephus saysF14Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 4.). So R. Gedaliah, in Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 76. 2. , he gave name to the Arphaxadaeans, whom he ruled over, now called Chaldeans; and indeed the name of the Chaldeans may as well be derived from the latter part of Arphaxad's name, &#1499;&#1513;&#1491; , &quot;Chashad&quot;, as from Chesed, the son of Nahor, and brother of Abraham, as it more commonly is; since the Chaldeans were called Chasdim before Chesed was born, and were a nation when Abraham came out of Ur, before Chesed could be old or considerable enough to build towns and found a nation; see Genesis 11:31   though Bochart treats this as a mere dream, yet he is obliged to have recourse to the usual refuge, that Ur was called Ur of the Chaldees, by anticipation. The fourth son of Shem was Lud, from whom sprung the Lydians, a people of Asia minor, and whose country is called Lydia, including Mysia and Caria, which all lay by the river Maeander; and Lud, in the Phoenician language, signifies bending and crooked, as that river was, being full of windings and turnings: some think that the posterity of Lud are carried too far off from those of his brethren, but know not where else to fix them. From Aram, the last son of Shem, sprung the Aramaeans, called by the Greeks Syrians, as JosephusF15Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 4.)  observes; and by HomerF16Iliad. 2.  and HesiodF17Theogonia.     &#945;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#953; , and so says StraboF18Geograph. l. 13. p. 431. l. 16. p. 540. ; some by the Arimi understand the Syrians, now called Arami; and elsewhereF19Ib. l. 1. p. 28.  he observes, that they who are by us called Syrians, are by the Syrians themselves called Aramaeans, and this is the name they give to themselves to this day: the country inhabited by them included Mesopotamia and Syria, and particularly all those places that have the name of Aram added to them, as Padan Aram, and Aram Naharaim (which is Mesopotamia), Aram of Damascus, Aram Zobah, Aram Maacha, and Aram Beth Rehob, Genesis 28:2   and the title of Psalm 60:1 , the Septuagint version here adds, &quot;and Cainan&quot;, but without any authority. </p>

<p>And the children of Aram ,.... The four following persons are called the sons of Shem, 1 Chronicles 1:17   being his grandsons, which is not unusual in Scripture: </p>
<p> Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash : the first of these sons of Aram, Uz, is generally thought to be the founder of Damascus; so JosephusF20Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 4.)  says. Usus founded Trachonitis and Damascus, which lies between Palestine and Coelesyria: there was a place called Uz in Idumea, Lamentations 4:21   and another in Arabia, where Job dwelt, Job 1:1   but neither of them seems to be the seat of this man and his posterity, who, in all probability, settled in Syria: his second son Hul, whom JosephusF21Ibid.  calls Ulus, according to him, founded Armenia; which notion may be strengthened by observing that Cholobotene is reckoned a part of Armenia by StephanusF23Apud Bochart. Phaleg. l. 2. c. 9. col. 81. ; which is no other than Cholbeth, that is, the house or seat of Chol, the same with Hul; and there are several places in Armenia, as appears from PtolemyF24Geograph. l. 5. c. 13. , which begin with Chol or Col, as Cholus, Cholua, Choluata, Cholima, Colsa, Colana, Colchis: but perhaps it may be better to place him in Syria, in the deserts of Palmyrene, as Junius and Grotius; since among the cities of Palmyrene, there is one called Cholle, according to PtolemyF25Geograph. l. 5. c. 15. . Gether, the third son, is made by JosephusF26Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 4.)  to be the father of the Bactrians; but these were too far off to come from this man, and were not in the lot of Shem: BochartF1Phaleg. l. 2. c. 10.  finds the river Getri, which the Greeks call Centrites, between Armenia and the Carduchi, whereabout, he conjectures, might be the seat of this man; but perhaps it may be more probable, with Grotius and Junius, to place him in Coelesyria, where are the city Gindarus of PtolemyF2Geograph. l. 5. c. 15. , and a people called Gindareni, by PlinyF3Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 23. ; though Bishop Patrick thinks it probable that Gadara, the chief city of Peraea, placed by PtolemyF4Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 5. c. 15.)  in the Decapolis of Coelesyria, had its name from this man: Mr. Broughton derives Atergate and Derceto, names of a Syrian goddess, from him, which was worshipped at Hierapolis in Coelesyria, as Pliny saysF5Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 23. . The last of the sons of Aram, Mash, is called Meshech, in 1 Chronicles 1:17   and here the Septuagint version calls him Masoch; his posterity are supposed to settle in Armenia, about the mountain Masius, thought to be the same with Ararat, and which the Armenians call Masis; perhaps the people named Moscheni, mentioned by PlinyF6Ib. l. 6. c. 9. , as dwelling near Armenia and Adiabene, might spring from this man. </p>

<p>And Arphaxad begat Salah ,.... Or Shelach which signifies &quot;a sending forth&quot;; that is, of waters: it is part of the name of Methuselah, given him by his father, as prophetic of the flood, see Genesis 5:21   and Arphaxad, who was born two years after the flood, gives this name to his first born, as commemorative of it: according to some, from him are the SusiansF7Vid. Bochart. Phaleg. l. 2. c. 13. col. 92. ; and in Susiana is found a city called Sele, by PtolemyF8Geograph. l. 6. c. 3. ; but this seems not to be a sufficient proof: </p>
<p> and Salah begat Eber ; from whom, JosephusF9Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 4.)  says, the Jews were called Hebrews from the beginning; and which, perhaps, is as good a derivation of their name as can be given, and seems to be confirmed by Numbers 24:24   though some derive it from Abraham's passing over the rivers in his way from Chaldea into Syria; but be it so, why might not this name be given to Eber, as prophetic of that passage, or of the passage of his posterity over the Euphrates into Canaan, as well as Eber gave to his son Peleg his name, as a prediction of the division of the earth in his time? the Septuagint version of this text inserts a Cainan between Arphaxad and Salah, but is not to be found in any Hebrew copy, nor in the Samaritan, Syriac, and Arabic versions, nor in Josephus, see Luke 3:36 . </p>

<p>And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg ,.... BochartF11Phaleg. l. 2. c. 14. col. 93.  thinks, that either Peleg, or one of his posterity, in memory of him, gave the name of Phalga to a town situated on the Euphrates; though the reason of the name, as given by Arrianus, as he himself observes, was because it divided between the two Seleucias, as the reason of Peleg's name was: </p>
<p> for in his days was the earth divided ; among the three sons of Noah, and their respective posterities; their language was divided, and that obliged them to divide and separate in bodies which understood one another; hence that age, in which was this event, was usually called by the Jews the age of division; whether this was done about the time of his birth, and so this name was given him to perpetuate the memory of it, or in some after part of his life, and so was given by a spirit of prophecy, is a question: Josephus, Jarchi, and the Jewish writers, generally go the latter way; if it was at the time of his birth, which is the sense of many, then this affair happened in the one hundred and first year after the flood, for in that year Peleg was born, as appears from Genesis 11:11 . </p>

<p> and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah : to the first of these, Sheleph, the Targum of Jonathan adds,&quot;who drew out the water of the rivers;'his people are supposed by BochartF19Phaleg. l. 2. c. 16.  Colossians 99 . , to be the Alapeni of PtolemyF20Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 6. c. 5.) , which should be read Salapeni, who were, he says, more remote from the rest, almost as far as the neck of Arabia, and not far from the spring of the river Betius. The next son, Hazarmaveth, or Hasermoth, as in the Vulgate Latin, is thought to give name to a people in Arabia, called by PlinyF21Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 28.  Chatramotitae, and by Ptolemy Cathramonitae, whose country, Strabo saysF23Geograph. l. 16. p. 528. , produces myrrh; according to PtolemyF24Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 6. c. 5.)  they reached from the mountain Climax to the Sabaeans, among whom were a people, called, by PlinyF25Nat. Hist. l. 12. c. 14. , Atramitae, who inhabited a place of the same name, and which Theophrastus calls Adramyta, which comes nearer the name of this man, and signifies the court or country of death: and in those parts might be places so called, partly from the unwholesomeness of the air, being thick and foggy, and partly from the frankincense which grew there, which was fatal to those that gathered it, and therefore only the king's slaves, and such as were condemned to die, were employed in it, as BochartF26Phaleg. l. 2. c. 17.  Colossians 102 .  has observed from Arrianus; as also because of the multitude of serpents, with which those odoriferous countries abounded, as the same writer relates from Agatharcides and Pliny. The next son of Joktan is Jerah, which signifies the moon, as Hilal does in Arabic; and Alilat with the Arabians, according to HerodotusF1Thalia sive, l. 3. c. 8. , is &quot;Urania&quot;, or the moon; hence BochartF2Ut supra, (Phaleg. l. 2.) c. 19.  thinks, that the Jeracheans, the posterity of Jerah, are the Alilaeans of Diodorus SiculusF3Bibliothec. l. 3. p. 179. , and others, a people of the Arabs; and the Arabic geographer, as he observes, makes mention of a people near Mecca called Bene Hilal, or the children of Jerah; and he is of opinion that the island Hieracon, which the Greeks call the island of the Hawks placed by PtolemyF4Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 6. c. 5.) , in Arabia Felix, adjoining to the country which lies upon the Arabian Gulf, is no other than the island of the Jeracheans, the posterity of this man: the ArabsF5Apud Pocock.

ZacuthF9Juchasin, fol. 135. 2.  says, the Jews which dwelt in Yaman, the kingdom of Sheba, call Samea, which is the capital of the kingdom of Yaman, Uzal; and who also relates, that there is a place called Hazarmaveth unto this day, of which see Genesis 10:26   the kingdom in which Uzal is said by him to be was the south part of Arabia Felix, as Yaman signifies, from whence came the queen of the south, Matthew 12:42   and Uzal or Auzal, as the Arabs pronounce it, is the same the Greeks call Ausar, changing &quot;L&quot; into &quot;R&quot;; hence mention is made by PlinyF11Nat. Hist. l. 12. c. 16.  of myrrh of Ausar, in the kingdom of the Gebanites, a people of the Arabs, where was a port by him called OcilaF12lb. c. 19. , by Ptolemy, OcelisF13Ut supra.

<p>And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab ,.... If several of the sons of Joktan went into India, as the Arabs say, one would be tempted to think that Ophir in India, whither Solomon sent his ships once in three years, had its name from the first of these; See Gill on Genesis 10:26   but as this would be carrying him too far from the rest of his brethren, who appear to have settled in Arabia, some place must be found for him there; and yet there is none in which there is any likeness of the name, unless Coper can be thought to be, a village in the country of the Cinaedocolpites, on the Arabian Gulf, as in PtolemyF6Geograph. l. 6. c. 7. , or Ogyris, an island in the same sea, PlinyF7Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 28.  makes mention of the same with the Organa of PtolemyF8Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 6. c. 7.) , placed by him on the Sachalite bay; wherefore BochartF9Phaleg. l. 2. c. 27.  looks out elsewhere for a seat for this Ophir, or &quot;Oupheir&quot;, as in the Septuagint version, and finding in a fragment of Eupolemus, preserved by EusebiusF11Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 30. p. 457. , mention made of the island of Ourphe, which he thinks should be Ouphre, or Uphre, situated in the Red sea, seems willing to have it to be the seat of this man and his posterity, and that it had its name from him; or that their seat was among the Cassanites or Gassandae, the same perhaps with the tribe of Ghassan, Aupher and Chasan signifying much the same, even great abundance and treasure: Havilah, next mentioned, is different from Havilah, the son of Cush, Genesis 10:7   and so his country; but it is difficult where to fix him; one would rather think that the Avalite bay, emporium, and people, should take their name from him than from Obal, Genesis 10:28   but BochartF12Ut supra, (Phaleg. l. 2.) c. 20.  chooses to place him and his posterity in Chaulan, a country in Arabia Felix, in the extreme part of Cassanitis, near the Sabaeans: and Jobab, the last of Joktan's sons, was the father of the Jobabites, called by PtolemyF13Ut supra. (Geograph. l. 6. c. 7.)  Jobarites, corruptly for Jobabites, as Salmasius and Bochart think; and who are placed by the above geographer near the Sachalites in Arabia Felix, whose country was full of deserts, as Jobab in Arabic signifies, so BochartF14Ut supra, (Phaleg. l. 2.) c. 29.  observes, as the countries above the Sachalite bay were, by which these Jobabites are placed: </p>

<p>And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Zephar, a mount of the east.  Mesha, which is thought to be the Muza of Ptolemy and Pliny, was a famous port in the Red sea, frequented by the merchants of Egypt and Ethiopia, from which the Sappharites lay directly eastward; to whose country they used to go for myrrh and frankincense, and the like, of which Saphar was the metropolis, and which was at the foot of Climax, a range of mountains, which perhaps might be formerly called Saphar, from the city at the bottom of it, the same with Zephar here: by inspecting Ptolemy's tablesF15Geograph. l. 6. c. 7. , the way from one to the other is easily discerned, where you first meet with Muza, a port in the Red sea, then Ocelis, then the mart Arabia, then Cane, and so on to Sapphar or Sapphara; and so Pliny saysF16Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 23. , there is a third port which is called Muza, which the navigation to India does not put into, only the merchants of frankincense and Arabian odours: the towns in the inland are the royal seat Saphar; and another called Sabe; now the sons of Joktan had their habitations all from this part in the west unto Zephar or Saphar eastward, and those were reckoned the genuine Arabs: HillerusF17Onomastic. Sacr. p. 116.  gives a different account of the situation of the children of Joktan, as he thinks, agreeably to these words of Moses; understanding by Kedem, rendered the east, the mountains of Kedem, or the Kedemites, which sprung from Kedem or Kedomah, the youngest son of Ishmael, Genesis 25:15   and Zephar, the seat of the Sepharites, as between Mesha and Kedem; for, says he, Mesha is not Muza, a mart of the Red sea, but Moscha, a famous port of the Indian sea, of which Arrian and Ptolemy make mention; and from hence the dwelling of the Joktanites was extended, in the way you go through the Sepharites to the mountainous places of Kedem or Cadmus: perhaps nearer the truth may be the Arabic paraphrase of SaadiahF18In Pocock. Specimen Hist. Arab. p. 34. , which is&quot;from Mecca till you come to the city of the eastern mountain, or (as in a manuscript) to the eastern city,'meaning perhaps Medina, situate to the east; so that the sense is, according to this paraphrase, that the sons of Joktan had their dwelling from Mecca to Medina; and so R. ZacuthF19In Juchasin, fol. 135. 2.  says, Mesha in the Arabic tongue is called Mecca; and it is a point agreed upon by the Arabs that Mesha was one of the most ancient names of Mecca; they believe that all the mountainous part of the region producing frankincense went in the earliest times by the name of Sephar; from whence Golius concludes this tract to be the Mount Zephar of Moses, a strong presumption of the truth of which is that Dhafar, the same with the modern Arabs as the ancient Saphar, is the name of a town in Shihr, the only province in Arabia bearing frankincense on the coast of the Indian oceanF20Universal History, vol. 18. p. 353. . </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 11  </p>
<p> This chapter gives an account of the inhabitants of the earth before the confusion of tongues at Babel, of their speech and language, which was one and the same, and of the place where they dwelt, Genesis 11:1   and of their design to build a city and tower, to make them a name and keep them together, which they put in execution, Genesis 11:3   of the notice the Lord took of this affair, and of the method he took to put a stop to their designs, by confounding their speech, and dispersing them abroad upon the face of the earth, Genesis 11:5   then follows a genealogy of Shem's posterity down to Abraham, Genesis 11:10   and a particular relation is given of Terah, the father of Abraham, and his family, and of his going forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, in order to go into the land of Canaan, and of his death at Haran by the way, Genesis 11:27 . </p>

<p>And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech ,.... Or had beenF23&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;   &quot;et fuerat&quot;, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator; &quot;caeterum fuit olim&quot;, Schmidt. , before the flood, and from that time to this, and still was, until the confusion took place; the account of which, and the occasion of it, are given in this chapter: by the whole earth is meant the inhabitants of it, see Isaiah 37:18   and so the Jerusalem Targum paraphrases the words,&quot;and all the generations of the earth were of one language, and of one speech, and of one counsel, for they spoke in the holy tongue in which the world was created at the beginning;'and to the same purpose the Targum of Jonathan: all the posterity of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, used the same language, though it does not appear that they were all in one counsel or consultation, or of one mind about building a city or tower, which the Targum seems to suggest; for it is not likely that Shem and his sons were in it: nor by &quot;one lip&quot; and &quot;the same words or things&quot;F24&#1513;&#1508;&#1492;  &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;  &#1493;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  &#1488;&#1492;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;   &quot;unum labium et verba eadem&quot;, Schmidt; &quot;Labii unius et sermonum eorundem, vel rerum&quot;, Clarius. , as these phrases may be rendered, are we to understand the same simplicity of speech and business, and likeness of manners; for it appears there was a difference with respect to these in the immediate sons of Noah, and it may be supposed to be much more in their remote offspring; nor as if they were all of the same religion, embraced the same doctrines, and spoke the same things; for as idolatry and superstition obtained in the race of Cain before the flood, so Ham and his posterity soon fell into the same, or the like, afterwards: and it may be observed that the same distinction was made of the children of God, and of the children of men, before the confusion and dispersion, as was before the flood, Genesis 11:5   from whence it appears they were not in the same sentiments and practice of religion: but this is to be understood of one and the same language, without any diversity of dialects, or without any hard and strange words, not easily understood; and perhaps it was pronounced by the lip and other instruments of speech in the same way; so that there was no difficulty in understanding one another, men, women, and children, all the people in common, princes and peasants, wise and unwise, all spoke the same language and used the same words; and this the Targumists take to be the holy or Hebrew language; and so Jarchi and Aben Ezra, and the Jewish writers in general, and most Christians; though some make a question of it, whether it might not be rather the Syriac, or Chaldee, or Arabic; but there is no need of such a question, since these with the Hebrew are all one and the same language; and no doubt it was the eastern language, without giving it any other name, which now subsists in the above dialects, though not in anyone alone, which was first spoken; though more purely and without the difference of dialects it now consists of, or without the various different inflexions now made in it; for nothing is more reasonable to suppose, than that the language Adam spoke was used by Noah, since Adam lived within one hundred years and a little more of the birth of Noah; and it is not to be questioned but Noah's sons spoke the same language as he did, and their posterity now, which was but little more than one hundred years after the flood: there are various testimonies of Heathens confirming this truth, that originally men spoke but one language; thus Sibylla in JosephusF25Antiqu. l. 1. c. 4. sect. 3. , who says,&quot;when all men were    &#959;&#956;&#959;&#966;&#969;&#957;&#969;&#957; , of the same language, some began to build a most high tower, &c.'so AbydenusF26Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 9. c. 14. p. 416.  an Heathen historian, speaking of the building of the tower of Babel, says,&quot;at that time men were    &#959;&#956;&#959;&#947;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#962; , of the same tongue;'in like manner HyginusF1Fabulae, Fab. 143. , speaking of Phoroneus, the first of mortals, that reigned, says,&quot;many ages before, men lived without towns and laws, &quot;una lirgua loquentes&quot;, speaking one language, under the empire of Jove.' </p>

<p>And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east ,.... That is, the inhabitants of the whole earth; not Ham and his posterity only, or Nimrod and his company; but as all the sons of Noah and his posterity for a while dwelt together, or at least very near each other, and finding the place where they were too scanty for them, as their several families increased, they set out in a body from the place where they were, to seek for a more convenient one: it seems a little difficult how to interpret this phrase, &quot;from the east&quot;, since if they came from Ararat in Armenia, where the ark rested, as that lay north of Shinar or Babylon, they might rather be said to come from the north than from the east, and rather came to it than from it: so some think the phrase should be rendered, &quot;to the east&quot;F2&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;   &quot;ad Orientem, sive Orientem versus&quot;; so some in Schmidt. Vid. Drusium in loc. & Fuller. Miscell. Sacr. l. 1. c. 4. , or eastward, as in Genesis 13:11 . Jarchi thinks this refers to Genesis 10:30   &quot;and their dwelling was&quot;, &c. at &quot;the mountain of the east&quot;; from whence he supposes they journeyed, to find out a place that would hold them all, but could find none but Shinar; but then this restrains it to Joktan's sons, and besides, their dwelling there was not until after the confusion and dispersion. But it is very probable the case was this, that when Noah and his sons came out of the ark, in a little time they betook themselves to their former habitation, from whence they had entered into the ark, namely, to the east of the garden of Eden, where was the appearance of the divine Presence, or Shechinah; and from hence it was that these now journeyed: and so it was as they were passing on: </p>
<p> that they found a plain in the land of Shinar ; which the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases the land of Babylon; and HestiaeusF3Apud Joseph. Antiqu. l. 1. c. 4. sect. 3. , a Phoenician historian, calls it Sennaar of Babylon; there are plain traces of this name in the Singara of PtolemyF4Geograph. l. 5. c. 18.  and PlinyF5Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 24. , the Hebrew letter &#1506;   being sometimes pronounced as &quot;G&quot;, as in Gaza and Gomorrah; the first of these place a city of this name in Mesopotamia, near the Tigris, and that of the other is reckoned a capital of the Rhetavi, a tribe of the Arabs, near Mesopotamia. This plain was very large, fruitful, and delightful, and therefore judged a fit place for a settlement, where they might have room enough, and which promised them a sufficient sustenance: </p>
<p> and they dwelt there ; and provided for their continuance, quickly beginning to build a city and tower, afterwards called Babylon: and that Babylon was built in a large plain is not only here asserted, but is confirmed by HerodotusF6Clio sive, l. 1. c. 178. , who says of it, that it lay    &#949;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#948;&#953;&#969; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#969; , in a vast plain, and so StraboF7Geograph. l. 16. p. 508. ; which was no other than the plain of Shinar. </p>

<p>And they said one to another, go to ,.... Advising, exhorting, stirring up, and encouraging one another to the work proposed, of building a city and tower for their habitation and protection; saying: </p>
<p> let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly ; they knew the nature of bricks, and how to make them before: according to SanchoniathoF8Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 1. p. 35. , the brothers of Vulcan, or Tubalcain, before the flood, were the first inventors of them; for he relates, that&quot;there are some that say that his brothers invented the way of making walls of bricks: he adds, that from the generation of Vulcan came two brothers, who invented the way of mixing straw or stubble with brick clay, and to dry them by the sun, and so found out tiling of houses.'Now in the plain of Shinar, though it afforded no stones, yet they could dig clay enough to make bricks, and which they proposed to burn thoroughly, that they might be fit for their purpose. According to an eastern traditionF9Elmacinus, p. 14. apud Hottinger. Smegma, p. 263,264. , they were three years employed in making and burning those bricks, each of which was thirteen cubits long, ten broad, and five thick, and were forty years in building: </p>
<p> and they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar : they could not get stone, which they would have chosen, as more durable; they got the best bricks they could make, and instead of mortar they used slime; or what the Septuagint version calls &quot;asphaltos&quot;, a bitumen, or kind of pitch, of which there was great plenty in that neighbourhood. HerodotusF11Clio sive, l. 1. c. 179.  speaking of the building of Babylon, uses language very much like the Scripture;&quot;digging a foss or ditch (says he), the earth which was cast up they formed into bricks, and drawing large ones, they burnt them in furnaces, using for lime or mortar hot asphaltos or bitumen.'And he observes, that&quot;Eight days journey from Babylon was another city, called Is, where was a small river of the same name, which ran into the river Euphrates, and with its water were carried many lumps of bitumen, and from hence it was conveyed to the walls of Babylon.'This city is now called Ait, of which a travellerF12Cartwright's Preacher's Travels, p. 105,106.  of the last century gives the following account;&quot;from the ruins of old Babylon we came to a town called Ait, inhabited only with Arabians, but very ruinous; near unto which town is a valley of pitch, very marvellous to behold, and a thing almost incredible wherein are many springs throwing out abundantly a kind of black substance, like unto tar and pitch, which serveth all the countries thereabout to make staunch their barks and boats; everyone of which springs makes a noise like a smith's forge, which never ceaseth night nor day, and the noise is heard a mile off, swallowing up all weighty things that come upon it; the Moors call it &quot;the mouth of hell.&quot;'Curtius relatesF13Hist. l. 5. c. 1. , that Alexander, in his march to Babylon, came to a city called Mennis, where was a cavern, from whence a fountain threw out a vast quantity of bitumen or pitch; so that, says he, it is plain, that the huge walls of Babylon were daubed with the bitumen of this fountain; and he afterwards speaks of the walls, towers, and houses, being built of brick, and cemented with it; and so Diodorus Siculus saysF14Bibliothec l. 2. p. 96.  from Ctesias, that the walls of Babylon were built of bricks, cemented with bitumen; and not only these, but all Heathen authors that write of Babylon, confirm this; and not only historians, but poets, of which BochartF15Phaleg. l. 1. c. 11.  has made a large collection; as well as JosephusF16Antiqu. l. 1. c. 4. sect. 3.  speaks of it, and this sort of pitch still remains. Rauwolff saysF17Travels, par. 2. ch. 7. p. 138.  near the bridge over the Euphrates, where Babylon stood, are several heaps of Babylonian pitch, which is in some places grown so hard, that you may walk over it; but in others, that which hath been lately brought over thither is so soft, that you may see every step you make in it. </p>

<p>And they said, go to, let us build us a city and a tower ,.... Some Jewish writersF18In Pirke Eliezer, c. 24.  say, these are the words of Nimrod to his people; but it is a question whether he was now born, or if he was, must be too young to be at the head of such a body of people; but they are spoken to one another, or by the principal men among them to the common people, advising and encouraging to such an undertaking. It is generally thought what led them to it was to secure them from another flood, they might be in fear of; but this seems not likely, since they had the covenant and oath of God, that the earth should never be destroyed by water any more; and besides, had this been the thing in view, they would not have chosen a plain to build on, a plain that lay between two of the greatest rivers, Tigris, and Euphrates, but rather one of the highest mountains and hills they could have found: nor could a building of brick be a sufficient defence against such a force of water, as the waters of the flood were; and besides, but few at most could be preserved at the top of the tower, to which, in such a case, they would have betook themselves. The reason of this building is given in a following clause, as will be observed. Some think by &quot;a city and tower&quot; is meant, by the figure &quot;hendyadis&quot;, one and the same thing, a city with towers; and, according to CtesiasF19Apud Diodor. Sicul. Bibliothec, l. 2. p. 96. , there were two hundred and fifty towers in Babylon: but no doubt the city and tower were two distinct things; or there was one particular tower proposed to be built besides the city, though it might stand in it, or near it, as an acropolis or citadel to it; as it is not unusual in cities to have such, to betake unto in case of danger: </p>
<p> whose top may reach unto heaven : not that they imagined such a thing could be literally and strictly done, but that it should be raised exceeding high, like the cities in Canaan, said to be walled up to heaven, Deuteronomy 1:28   hyperbolically speaking; and such was the tower of Babel, by all accounts, even of Heathens: the Sibyl in JosephusF20Antiqu. l. 1. c. 4. sect. 3.  calls it a most high tower; and so AbydenusF21Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 9. c. 14. p. 416.  reports;&quot;there are (says he) that say, that the first men that rose out of the earth, proud of their strength and largeness (of their bodies), and thinking themselves greater than the gods, erected a tower of a vast height, near to heaven, where Babylon now is.'And the temple of Belus, which some take to be the same with this tower, at least was that perfected, and put to such an use, was, according to CtesiasF23Apud Diodor. ut supra, (Sicul. Bibliothec, l. 2.) p. 98. , of an immense height, where the Chaldeans made their observations of the stars: however, the tower that was in the middle of it, and which seems plainly to be the same with this, was exceeding high: the account HerodotusF24Clio sive, l. 1. c. 181.  gives of it is,&quot;in the midst of the temple a solid tower is built, of a furlong in length, and of as much in breadth; and upon this tower another tower is placed, and another upon that, and so on to eight towers.'   &#956;&#951;&#954;&#959;&#962; , the word used by Herodotus, translated &quot;length&quot;, signifies also &quot;height&quot;, and so it is taken here by some; and if so, it looks as if every tower was a furlong high, which makes the whole a mile, which is too extravagant to suppose, though it may denote the height of them all, a furlong, which makes it a very high building. This agrees with Strabo's account of it, who calls it a pyramid, and says it was a furlong highF25Geograph. l. 16. p. 508. : according to RauwolffF26Travels, ut supra. (pars. 2. ch. 7. p. 138.) , the tower of Babel is still in being; this, says he, we saw still (in 1574), and it is half a league in diameter; but it is so mightily ruined, and low, and so full of vermin, that hath bored holes through it, that one may not come near it for half a mile, but only in two months in the winter, when they come not out of their holes. Another travellerF1Cartwright's Preacher's Travels, p. 99, 100. , that was in those parts at the beginning of the last century, says,&quot;now at this day, that which remaineth is called the remnant of the tower of Babel; there standing as much as is a quarter of a mile in compass, and as high as the stone work of Paul's steeple in London--the bricks are three quarters of a yard in length, and a quarter in thickness, and between every course of bricks there lieth a course of mats, made of canes and palm tree leaves, so fresh as if they had been laid within one year.'Not to take notice of the extravagant account of the eastern writers, who say the tower was 5533 fathoms highF2Elmacinus, p. 14. Patricides, p. 13. apud Hottinger. Smegma, p. 264. ; and others, beyond all belief, make it 10,000 fathoms, or twelve miles highF3Vid. Universal History, vol. 1. p. 331. ; and they say the builders were forty years in building it: their design in it follows: </p>
<p> and let us make us a name ; which some render &quot;a sign&quot;F4Perizonius, apud Universal History, ib. p. 325. , and suppose it to be a signal set upon the top of the tower, which served as a beacon, by the sight of which they might be preserved from straying in the open plains with their flocks, or return again when they had strayed. Others take it to be an idol proposed to be set upon the top of the tower; and the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem intimate as if the tower was built for religious worship, paraphrasing the words,&quot;let us build in the midst of it a temple of worship on the top of it, and let us put a sword into his (the idol's) hand.'And it is the conjecture of Dr. Tennison, in his book of idolatry, that this tower was consecrated by the builders of it to the sun, as the cause of drying up the waters of the deluge: but the sense is, that they proposed by erecting such an edifice to spread their fame, and perpetuate their name to the latest posterity, that hereby it might be known, that at such a time, and in such a place, were such a body of people, even all the inhabitants of the world; and all of them the sons of one man, as Ben Gersom observes; so that as long as this tower stood, they would be had in remembrance, it being called after their names; just as the Egyptian kings afterwards built their pyramids, perhaps for a like reason; and in which the end of neither have been answered, it not being known who were by name concerned therein, see Psalm 49:11   though a late learned writerF5Dr. Clayton's Chronology of the Hebrew Bible, p. 56.  thinks, that by making a name is meant choosing a chief or captain, which was proposed by them; and that the person they pitched upon was Nimrod, in which sense the word he supposes is used, 2 Samuel 23:17   but what has been observed at the beginning of this note may be objected to it; though BerosusF6Antiqu. l. 4. p. 28, 29.  says, that Nimrod came with his people into the plain of Sannaar, where be marked out a city, and founded the largest tower, in the year of deliverance from the waters of the flood one hundred and thirty one, and reigned fifty six years; and carried the tower to the height and size of mountains, &quot;for a sign&quot; and &quot;monument&quot;, that the people of Babylon were the first in the world, and ought to be called the kingdom of kingdoms; which last clause agrees with the sense given: </p>
<p> lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth : which they seemed to have some notion of, and feared would be their case, liking better to be together than to separate, and therefore were careful to avoid a dispersion; it being some way or other signified to them, that it was the will of God they should divide into colonies, and settle in different parts, that so the whole earth might be inhabited; or Noah, or some others, had proposed a division of the earth among them, each to take his part, which they did not care to hearken to; and therefore, to prevent such a separation, proposed the above scheme, and pursued it. </p>

<p>And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower ,.... Not locally or visibly, being immense, omnipresent, and invisible; nor in order to see and take notice of what he otherwise could not see from heaven, for he is omniscient; but this is spoken after the manner of men, and is to be understood of some effects and displays of his power, which were manifest, and showed him to be present: the Targum is,&quot;and the Lord was revealed to take vengeance on them on account of the business of the city and tower the children of men built.'This shows the patience and longsuffering of God, that he did not immediately proceed against them, and his wisdom and justice in taking cognizance of the affair, and inquiring into it; examining the truth and reality of things before he passed judgment and took measures to hinder them in the execution of their design; all which must be understood agreeably to the divine Majesty, and as accommodated to the capacities of men, and as an instruction to them in judging matters they have a concern in: </p>
<p> which the children of men builded ; or were building, for they had not finished their building, at least not the city, as appears from Genesis 11:8 . These were either the whole body of the people, under the general appellation of &quot;the children of men&quot;: or else a part of them, distinguished by this character from the &quot;sons of God&quot;, who were truly religious; by which it seems that Noah, Shem, Arphaxad, Salah, and others, were not concerned in this affair, who though they might come with the rest unto Shinar, yet when they understood their design, refused to join with them in it; so that it was only the carnal and irreligious part of them, who very probably were by far the majority, and therefore there was no overruling their debates, and stopping them in their works, that were the builders; and these might be the posterity of Ham in general, with others of Shem and Japheth mixed with them.

<p> and this they begin to do ; to build the city and the tower, and had made considerable progress in it: </p>
<p> and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do ; they had prepared bricks, and slime or bitumen, a sufficient quantity for their use, or could easily come at more if they wanted; and they were not to be prevailed upon to desist from their work, by any advice that the sons of God could give them; they were obstinate and self-willed, and not to be argued with and persuaded to leave off; and there was no power on earth superior to them, to oblige them to it; they could only be restrained from their enterprise, and hindered from executing it, by divine power; and which was judged necessary to exert, as appears by what follows: and the words may be rendered, &quot;shall they not be restrained? &c.&quot; they shall. </p>

<p>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language ,.... These words are not spoken to the angels, as the Targum and Aben Ezra; for, as Philo the Jew observesF8De Confus. Ling. p. 344. , they are said to some as co-workers with God, which angels could not be in this work of confounding the language of men; it being above the power of creatures so to work upon the mind, and on the faculty of speech, as to make such an alteration as was at the confusion of tongues, when men were made to forget their former language, and had another put into their minds, and a faculty of speaking it given; or, however, the first language was so differently inflected and pronounced, that it seemed another, and various; all which could not be done but by him who is almighty, even that Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, said Genesis 11:8   to confound man's language; and the first of these speaks to the other two, with whom he consulted about doing it, and with whom he did it. Not that every man had a new and distinct language given him, for then there could have been no society and converse in the world, but one was given to each family; or rather to as many families as constituted a nation or colony, designed for the same place of habitation; how many there were, cannot be said with any certainty. Euphorus, and many other historiansF9Apud Clement. Alexandr. Strom. l. 1. p. 338. , say they were seventy five, according to the number of Jacob's posterity that went down into Egypt; others say seventy two: the Jewish writers generally agree with the Targum of Jonathan in making them seventy, according to the number of the posterity of Noah's sons, recorded in the preceding chapter; but several of them spoke the same language, as Ashur, Arphaxad, and Aram, spoke the Chaldee or Syriac language; the sons of Canaan one and the same language; and the thirteen sons of Joktan the Arabic language; Javari and Elisha the Greek language; so that, as BochartF11Phaleg. l. 1. c. 15. col. 55.  observes, scarce thirty of the seventy will remain distinct: and it is an observation of Dr. LightfootF12See his Works, vol. 1. p. 694.  not to be despised, that&quot;the fifteen named in Acts 2:5   were enough to confound the work (at Babel), and they may very well be supposed to have been the whole number.'The end to be answered it was: </p>
<p> that they may not understand one another's speech ; or &quot;hear&quot;F13&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;   &quot;audiant&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, &c. , that is, so as to understand; the words were so changed, and so differently pronounced from what they had used to hear, that though they heard the sound, they could not tell the meaning of them: hence, as Jarchi observes, when one asked for a brick, another brought him clay or slime, on which he rose up against him, and dashed his brains out. </p>

<p>So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence, upon the face of all the earth ,.... Hence that which they feared came upon them, and what they were so careful to guard against befell them, occasioned by those measures they took to secure themselves from it; for not being able to understand one another, they left off their design, and as many as spoke the same language joined together, and so parted in bodies; some went one way, and some another, and settled in different places, until at length, by degrees, the whole world was peopled by them, which was the will of God should be done, and was brought about in this way. The Heathen writers themselves ascribe this dispersion to a divine Being, as well as speaking different tongues. EupolemusF14Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 17. p. 418.  says, that first the city of Babylon was built by those that were saved from the flood, who were giants; and then they built tower, so much spoken of in history, which falling by the power of God, the giants were &quot;scattered throughout the whole earth&quot;. One would think this writer, by his language, must have read this account of Moses: some of them say the fall of the tower was by storms and tempests raised by the gods. So the Sybil in JosephusF15Antiqu. l. 1. c. 4. sect. 13.  says,&quot;the gods sending winds overthrew the tower, and gave to every one his own speech, and hence the city came to be called Babylon.'Agreeably to which AbydenusF16Apud Euseb. ut supra, (Praepar. Evangel. l. 9.) c. 14. p. 416. , an Assyrian writer, relates, that&quot;the winds being raised by the gods overthrew the mechanism (the tower) upon them (the builders of it), and out of the ruins of it was the city called Babylon, when those who were of the same language, from the gods spoke a different one, and of various sounds.'And so HestiaeusF17Apud Joseph. ut supra. (Antiqu. 1. 1. c. 4. sect. 13.) , a Phoenician writer, speaking of those who came to Sennaar or Shinar of Babylon, says, from thence they were scattered; and, because of the diversity of language, formed colonies everywhere, and everyone seized on that land which offered to him. These writers indeed seem to be mistaken as to the destruction of the tower, and that by tempestuous winds; otherwise they agree with Moses in the confusion of languages, and scattering of the people at the tower of Babel: in what year this was done is not certain; it was in the days of Peleg, who was born in the year one hundred and one after the flood; and if it was at the time of his birth, as many are of opinion, both JewsF18Vid. Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 75. 2.  and Christians, it must be in the above year; but the phrase used does not determine that: the eastern writersF19Elmacinus, p. 28. Patricides, p. 13. apud Hottinger. Smegma Oriental. p. 267.  say, that it was in the fortieth year of the life of Peleg, and then it must be in the year after the flood one hundred and forty one; but others, and which is the common opinion of the Jewish chronologersF20Seder Olam Rabba, c. 1. p. 1. Juchasin, fol. 8. 1. Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 1. 2. , say it was at the end of Peleg's days; and whereas he lived two hundred and thirty nine years, this must happen in the year three hundred and forty after the flood, and so it was ten years, as they observe, before the death of Noah, and when Abraham was forty eight years of age. But of this see more in Buxtorf's dissertation concerning the confusion of the Hebrew language. It follows here: </p>
<p> and they left off to build the city ; it seems they had finished the tower, but not the city, and therefore are only said to leave off building that; though the Samaritan and Septuagint versions add, &quot;and the tower&quot;; for not understanding one another, they were not able to go on with their work, for when they asked for one thing, as before observed out of Jarchi, they had another brought them; which so enraged them, that the Targum of Jonathan says they killed one another; and, say some Jewish writersF21Pirke Eliezer, c. 24. , they fought one with another upon this occasion, until half the world fell by the sword. (Unlike traditions of the Flood, legends of the Tower of Babel and confusion of speech are not common. (12) That said, noteworthy support for the biblical account comes from Babylonia itself, where a damaged inscription reads:&quot;Babylon corruptly proceeded to sin, and both small and great mingled on the mound....All day they founded their stronghold, but in the night he put a complete stop to it. In his anger he also poured out his secret counsel to scatter them abroad, he set his face, he gave a command to make foreign their speech.' (13-15)This appears to have some basis in an historical event and is very close to the biblical account. Likewise, the Roman mythographer Hyginus (floruit 10 BC) writes:&quot;Men for many generations led their lives without towns or laws, speaking one tongue under the rule of Jove. But after Mercury interpreted the language of men--whence an interpreter is called hermeneutes, for Mercury in Greek is called Hermes; he, too, distributed the nations--then discord began amoug the mortals.'

<p>Therefore is the name of it called Babel ,.... The name of the city mentioned, and the tower also, which signifies &quot;confusion&quot;, as the Septuagint version renders it; and so JosephusF23Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 4. sect. 13.)  says the Hebrews call confusion &quot;Babel&quot;: perhaps this name was given it by the sons of Eber, or it might be a common name preserved in all languages, as some are; and though the first builders desisted from going on with building it, yet it seems that afterwards Nimrod went on with it, and completed it, and made it the beginning of his kingdom, or his capital city; and perhaps he and his family might continue after the confusion and dispersion somewhere near unto it, see Genesis 10:10 . The reason of its name is given: </p>
<p> because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth ; and therefore it is false what is said by some, that the above city had its name from Babylon, the son of Belus: </p>
<p> and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth ; which is repeated for the confirmation of it, and that it might be taken notice of and observed as a very wonderful and important event. These Babel builders were an emblem of self-righteous persons, who, as those were, are the greater part of the world, and, under different forms of religion, are all upon the same foot of a covenant of works; they all speak the same language; and indeed all men naturally do, declaring and seeking for justification by their own works; and journey from the east, depart from Christ, one of whose names is the east, or rising sun; they turn their backs on him and his righteousness; build on a plain, not on a rock or mountain, but on the sandy bottom of their own works, in a land of Shinar, or shaking, on a tottering foundation; their view is to get themselves a name, to be seen of men, and be applauded for their work sake, and that they might reach heaven, and get to it this way; but the issue of all is confusion and scattering abroad; for upon the foot of their own righteousness they can never enter into the kingdom of heaven. </p>

<p> in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees ; Ur, which Ben Melech renders a valley, was the place of his birth, as it was of Abram's; it was in Mesopotamia, that part of it next to Assyria being called the land of the Chaldeans; hence these are spoken of as the same by Stephen, Acts 7:2   mention is made by PlinyF2Nat.

Jarchi in loc.  have a fable concerning the death of Haran; they say that Terah was not only an idolater, but a maker and seller of images; and that one day going abroad, he left his son Abraham in the shop to sell them, who, during his father's absence, broke them all to pieces, except one; upon which, when Terah returned and found what was done, he had him before Nimrod, who ordered him to be cast into a burning furnace, and he should see whether the God he worshipped would come and save him; and while he was in it, they asked his brother Haran in whom he believed? he answered, if Abraham overcomes, he would believe in his God, but if not, in Nimrod; wherefore they cast him into the furnace, and he was burnt; and with respect to this it is said, &quot;and Haran died before the face of Terah his father&quot;; but Abraham came out safe before the eyes of them all. </p>

<p>And Abram and Nahor took them wives ,.... Very probably after the death of their elder brother Haran, whose daughters they married, at least one of them did, and some think both: </p>
<p> the name of Abraham's wife was Sarai : it is not said whose daughter she was, unless she is the same with Iscah, the daughter of Haran, and so had two names, Iscah her name before marriage, Sarai after it, Abram calling her &quot;my mistress&quot;, as &quot;Sarai&quot; signifies, as she called him my lord: so the Targum of Jonathan, Iscah, this is Sarai; in like manner Jarchi, Baal Hatturim, and other Jewish writersF6Bereshit Rabba, sect. 38. fol. 33. 3. 4. , take them to be the same; but according to Genesis 20:12   Sarai should be the daughter of Terah, the father of Abraham, by another woman; and so the Arabic writersF7Ut supra, (Elmacinus, p. 31. Patricides, p. 17.) apud Hottinger. p. 281.  say,&quot;the mother of Abraham died, whose name was Juna; and Terah married another wife, whose name was Lahazib; she bore him Sarah, whom Abraham afterwards married:&quot; </p>
<p> and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah : so that Nahor married his brother's daughter, which sort of marriage was then allowed of, as formerly that of own brothers and sisters, but afterwards was strictly forbidden in the Levitical law: this account is given of Nahor's wife, as Aben Ezra observes, to show the pedigree of Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah: some think, as before observed, that Abram married the other daughter of his brother Haran, Iscah, and that she is the same with Sarai; and indeed, without supposing that, it is difficult to conceive for what reason this should be observed, that Haran, the father of Milcah, was also the father of Iscah; and if Sarai is not Iscah, no account is given by Moses of her descent, which may seem strange; and it can hardly be thought he would omit it, when it must be so agreeable to his people to know from whom they descended, both by the father's and mother's side. </p>

<p>And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife ,.... Many words are made use of in describing Lot and Sarai, and yet still we are left pretty much in the dark who Sarai was; for, as Aben Ezra observes, if she was the sister of Abram and daughter of Terah, the Scripture would have said, Terah took Abram his son and Sarai his daughter, and wife of Abram; and if she was the sister of Lot, it would have said, and Sarai the daughter of his son, as it does of Lot: </p>
<p> and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan ; that is, as Jarchi interprets it, Terah and Abram went forth with Lot and Sarai, or &quot;with them&quot; may mean with Nahor and Milcah: for JosephusF8Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 5.)  says, that all went into Charan of Mesopotamia, the whole family of Terah; and the Arabic historianF9Elmacinus, p. 31. apud Hottinger. p. 282.  is express for it,&quot;Terah went out from Chorasan, and with him Abram, Nahor, Lot, his children, and their wives, and he went to Charan, where he dwelt:'and it is certain, if Nahor and his wife did not set out with them, they followed them afterwards, for Haran was the city of Nahor, where his family in later times dwelt, see Genesis 14:10   what moved Terah to depart from Ur of the Chaldees seems to be the call of God to Abram, which, though after related, was previous to this; and he acquainting his father Terah with it, he listened to it, being now convinced of his idolatry and converted from it, and readily obeyed the divine will; and being the father of Abram, is represented as the head of the family, as he was, and their leader in this transaction; who encouraged their departure from the idolatrous country in which they were, and set out with them to seek another, where they might more freely and safely worship the true God. Though JosephusF10Ut supra. (Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 5.)  represents it in this light, that Terah hating the country of Chaldea, because of the mourning of Haran, he and all his went out from thence: </p>
<p> and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there ; which JosephusF11Ibid.  calls Charan of Mesopotamia, and yet Stephen speaks of Abraham being in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Charan; but then Mesopotamia is to be taken both in a more general and a more limited sense; in general, it took in Mesopotamia and Chaldea, and in the eastern part of it was Ur of the Chaldees, and when Abram came from thence to Haran, he came into Mesopotamia, strictly so called. Stephen calls it Charran it is by HerodianF12Hist. l. 4. sect. 24.  called    &#954;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#945;&#953; , by PtolemyF13Geograph. l. 5. c. 18.  Carrae, by PlinyF14Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 24.

Benjamin of TudelaF16Itinerarium, p. 60.  speaks of it as in being in his time, and as two days journey from the entrance into the land of Shinar or Mesopotamia; and says, that in that place where was the house of Abraham, there is no building on it, but the Ishmaelites (the Mahometans) honour the place, and come thither to pray. Rauwolff, who was in this town A. D. 1575, calls it Orpha; his account of it is thisF17Travels, par. 2. ch. 10. sect. 176. by Ray. , that it is a costly city, with a castle situated on the hill very pleasantly; that the town is very pleasant, pretty big, with fortifications well provided; and that some say it was anciently called Haran and Charras: a later travellerF18Cartwright's Preacher's Travels, p. 14, 15.  says, who also calls it Orpha,&quot;the air of this city is very healthful, and the country fruitful; that it is built four square, the west part standing on the side of a rocky mountain, and the east part tendeth into a spacious valley, replenished with vineyards, orchards, and gardens: the walls are very strong, furnished with great store of artillery, and contain in circuit three English miles, and, for the gallantness of its sight, it was once reckoned the metropolitical seat of Mesopotamia.'What detained Terah and his family here, when they intended to go further, is not said. Aben Ezra suggests, that the agreeableness of the place to Terah caused him to continue there; but it is very probable he was seized with a disease which obliged them to stay here, and of which he died. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 12  </p>
<p> In this chapter an account is given of the call of Abram to depart from his own country, with a promise of a divine blessing, Genesis 12:1   of his obedience to it, Genesis 12:4   of his journey through the land of Canaan, and of the Lord's appearance to him in it, and his promise of it to his seed, and of Abram's building altars in it, and calling on the name of the Lord, Genesis 12:6   and of a famine there, which occasioned him to go into Egypt, Genesis 12:10   where, through fear of being slain, he desired his wife to call herself his sister, Genesis 12:11   and she being greatly admired by the Egyptians for her beauty, it went well with Abram for her sake, Genesis 12:14   but the Egyptians were plagued because of her, who, when they understood she was Abram's wife, sent them both away, and all that belonged to them, Genesis 12:17 . </p>

<p>Now the Lord had said unto Abram ,.... In Ur of the Chaldees, before he came and dwelt in Charran, as seems from Acts 7:2   and so Aben Ezra interprets it; but Jarchi and others think, that what follows was said to him in Haran, and so the words may be more literally renderedF21&#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;   &quot;et dixit&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius. , &quot;and the Lord said unto Abram&quot;; after the death of Terah, who died in Haran; and indeed it is highly probable there were two appearances of God to Abram, and that the same words, or very near the same, were spoken to him at two several times, first in Ur of the Chaldees, and then in Haran: </p>
<p> get thee out of thy country ; the land of Chaldea, and the city of Ur, which was in it, or out of Mesopotamia, in which, when taken in a large sense, were both Ur and Haran; and this country was now become idolatrous, for though it was first inhabited and peopled by the posterity of Shem in the time of Arphaxad, yet these, in process of time, degenerated from the true religion, and fell into idolatry. The same MaimonidesF23More Nevochim, par. 3. c. 29. p. 421.  calls Zabaeans, in whose faith and religion, he says, Abram was brought up, and who asserted there was no other God but the sun, moon, and stars; and these Zabaeans, as he relates from their books and annals, say of Abram themselves, that he was educated in Cuthia, and dissented from the common people; and asserted, that besides the sun, there was another Creator; to whom they objected, and so disputes arose among them on this subject: now Abram being convinced of idolatry, is called out from those people, and to have no fellowship with them; it is literally in the Hebrew textF24&#1500;&#1498;  &#1500;&#1498;   &quot;vade tibi&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus, Drusius, &c. , &quot;go to thee out of thy country&quot;; for thy profit and good, as Jarchi interprets it; as it must be to quit all society with such an idolatrous and superstitious people: </p>
<p> and from thy kindred ; as Nahor his brother, and his family, who are not mentioned, and seem to be left behind when Terah, Abram, Lot, and Sarai, came out of Ur of the Chaldees; though it looks as if afterwards Nahor did follow them to Haran or Padanaram, which are the same, and where he continued, and therefore is called his city; see Genesis 24:10   so with great propriety Abram might be called a second time to leave his kindred as well as his country; and certain it is, Haran, or Padanaram, as well as Ur of the Chaldees, is called by himself his country, and Nahor and his family his kindred, Genesis 24:4 . </p>
<p> and from thy father's house ; or household, his family, which better agrees with the second call at Haran, than with the first at Ur; for, upon the first call, Terah and his family came along with Abram, and therefore this phrase is omitted by Stephen, who speaks of that call, Acts 7:3   but Terah dying at Haran, his house or family went no further, but continued there with Nahor; only Abram and Lot, upon this second call, went from thence, as the following history makes it appear; and so Abram left, as he was bid, his father's house and family to go, as it follows: </p>
<p> unto a land that I will show thee ; meaning the land of Canaan, though not mentioned, and seems to be omitted for the trial of Abram's faith; hence the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, Hebrews 11:8   observes, that &quot;he obeyed and went out, not knowing whither he went&quot;; and yet it is said, that, when he and Terah came out of Ur of the Chaldees, &quot;they went forth to go into the land of Canaan&quot;, Genesis 11:31   and, when he and Lot went first from Haran, the same is said of them, Genesis 12:5   it is probable the case was this; there was no mention made at first what land he was to go to, and when he prepared for his journey he knew not where he was to go, but afterwards it was revealed to him that Canaan was the land, and therefore set out in order to go thither; and still, though he might know the place by name where he was to go, he might neither know the way to it, nor what sort of country it was for quality or quantity; and therefore God promises to show him the way, and direct his course right unto it, and give him a view of it, that he might see what sort of a country, and how large it was, that he would give to his posterity. This call of Abram is an emblem of the call of men by the grace of God out of the world, and from among the men of it, and to renounce the things of it, and not be conformed unto it, and to forget their own people and their father's house, and to cleave to the Lord, and follow him whithersoever he directs them. </p>

<p> and I will bless thee ; not only with temporal blessings, but principally with spiritual ones, since Abram in person had no share of the land of Canaan; even with the adoption of children and friendship with God; with justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ, which blessedness came upon him when uncircumcised; with a large measure of faith, and every other grace; with the sanctification of the Spirit, and an increase of it until brought to perfection; and with eternal glory and happiness, a right, title, and meetness for it, and the full possession of it: </p>
<p> and make thy name great ; as it was among the Jews his descendants, who boasted of having Abram for their father; and among the several nations of the world; his name is famous in profane history, and is in high esteem with the Mahometans to this day; and especially his name is great and famous, and the memory of him precious among all those who have obtained like precious faith with him, in every age and in every nation: </p>

<p>And I will bless them that bless thee ,.... Not the priests only that should bless his children, the children of Israel, as the Targum of Jonathan, but all men of all nations, and of every age, that speak well of him, commend him for his faith and holiness, and tread in his steps, these are blessed with faithful Abraham, Galatians 3:7 . </p>
<p> And curse him that curseth thee ; here is a change of numbers, before the plural, here the singular, denoting, it may be, that many would bless him, and but few curse him, and that every individual person that did curse him should be cursed himself: the Targum of Jonathan wrongly restrains this to Balaam's cursing Abraham's children, and was cursed by God; MaimonidesF25More Nevochim, ut supra. (par. 3. c. 29. p. 421.)  thinks, there is no doubt to be made of it, that the Zabaeans, the idolatrous people Abram was brought up with, when he contradicted them, loaded him with curses and reproaches; and, because he bore them all patiently for the glory of God, as became him, therefore these words are said; but they, without question, respect future as well as present times, and regard all such, in every age and of every nation, that disapproves of, or rejects and reproaches Abram's God, his faith, his religion, and his people. </p>
<p> And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed ; that is, in his seed, as in Genesis 22:18   and which is interpreted of Christ, Acts 3:25   meaning not every individual of all the families or nations of the earth; but that as many as believe in Christ, of all nations, are blessed in him; and that whoever of them are blessed, they are blessed and only blessed in him, and that they are blessed for his sake with all spiritual blessings; see Ephesians 1:3   such as redemption, justification, remission of sins, sanctification, adoption, and eternal life. </p>

<p>So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him ,.... Or, &quot;when the Lord had spoken to him&quot;, as Cocceius renders the words; when he had called him a second time, even when in Haran, immediately after the death of his father Terah; as soon as ever the words were spoken to him before recorded, he immediately prepared and got all things ready for his journey, and departed from Haran, as he had done before from Ur of the Chaldees: </p>
<p> and Lot went with him ; of his own accord, and he only, besides his wife Sarai and his servants, for Terah was dead, and Nahor and his family stayed behind. </p>
<p> And Abram was seventy five years old when he departed out of Haran ; by which it appears, as has been observed, that he was not Terah's eldest son, born when he was seventy years of age, Genesis 11:26   for then he must have been at this time, one hundred and thirty five years old, since his father, who was just now dead, lived to be two hundred and five years old, Genesis 11:32   so that Abram must be born in the one hundred and thirtieth year of Terah: how many years before this time he was converted from idolatry cannot be said with any certainty; various are the accounts given by the Jewish writers; some say that at three years of age he knew his Creator; others at eight; others thirteen; others more probably when forty; others fifty one; others fifty two; and others say he was sixty years old when he began publicly to assert the unity of God in heavenF26Vid.

<p>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son ,.... The son of Haran his brother, not against their wills, but with their full consent: Sarai went readily with him, not only as being his wife, and so obliged by the law of marriage and tie of relation, but on the score of religion; and Lot as being a good man, and so willing to go with him, as his near relation too, for the sake of religion. </p>
<p> And all their substance that they had gathered ; either in Ur of the Chaldees, or in Haran, and indeed in both; which, as it was their own property, they had a right to take with them, and it was their wisdom so to do, both for the support of their families, and for the service of religion; and it appears from hence that they were not slothful, but industrious persons, and by the blessing of God were succeeded in their employments: </p>
<p> and the souls that they had gotten in Haran ; the more excellent part of man being put for the whole; and the meaning is, either that were procreatedF1&#1506;&#1513;&#1493; , &quot;procreaverant&quot;, Piscator. , as some render it, or begotten by them; for, though Abram had no children, Lot had, and possibly some that might be begotten while there; and their servants might have children by their fellow servants, and to which Abram and Lot had a right, and therefore took them with them; or rather it means servants which they had bought with their money there, and so had gotten or obtained them as their own property: some understand it of the proselytes made during their stay there; and no doubt they were as industrious in spreading and propagating the true religion, as in acquiring substance and servants; and to this sense are the several Chaldee paraphrases; that of Onkelos is,&quot;and the souls which they made subject to the law in Haran;'the Targums of Jerusalem and Jonathan are,&quot;and the souls of the proselytes, or which they proselyted in Haran;'and with this agrees the note of Jarchi,&quot;which they brought under the wings of the Shechinah; Abram proselyted the men, and Sarai the women;'though in the literal sense he takes it to be the acquiring of servants and handmaids; there might be of both sorts, both proselytes and servants bought with money, which made up the number of three hundred and eighteen trained servants, Genesis 14:14   how long Abram stayed in Haran is not certain, it must be some time, to gather more substance, increase servants, and make proselytes; the JewsF2Seder Olam Rabba, Ganz. Tzemach David, par. 1. fol. 5. 2.  generally say he was there five years. </p>
<p> And they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan they came : which last clause is very fitly added, since, when they came out of Ur, they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, Genesis 11:31   but they did not then come into it, but stopped by the way at Haran; but now, when they went out from thence, they proceeded on in their journey, and made no stay any where of any length, until they came into the land of Canaan; which is reckoned to be three hundred miles from the one to the other, and by some four hundred to Sichem, and a troublesome way through the deserts of Palmyrene, and over the mountains of Lebanon and HermonF3See Sir Walter Raleigh's History of the World, par. 1. b. 2. sect. 3. p. 130. and Bunting's Travels, p. 56. : of Ura, Pliny saysF4Nat.

<p>And Abram passed through the land ,.... Entering the northern part of it, as appears by his going southward, Genesis 12:9   he went on </p>
<p> unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh ; the place afterwards called Shechem, from a prince of that name in the times of Jacob; and so it was called when Moses wrote, and therefore, by way of anticipation, calls it so here; it was about the middle of the land of Canaan, and the same with Sychar, a city of Samaria, in the times of Christ, John 4:5 . Moreh was the name of a man, from whence the plain took its name, which was near Sichem; some render it the oak of MorehF5&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;  &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;   &quot;quercetum More&quot;, Tigurine version, &quot;quercum Moreh&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus. , perhaps the same with that in Genesis 35:4   or a grove of oaks of that name; the Syriac and Arabic versions render it the oak of Mamre wrongly. </p>

<p>And there was a famine in the land ,.... The land of Canaan, which was a very fruitful country, abounding with all kind of provisions usually; but now there was a scarcity of all; and which was both for the sins of the inhabitants of the land, and for the trial of Abram's faith, who was brought out of his own country, where was bread enough and to spare, into one in which there was a famine; and this might be a temptation to Abram to return from whence he came, and to slight and despise the country that was given him: </p>
<p> and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there ; not to dwell there, only till the famine was over; and rightly is he said to go down to Egypt, since that lay lower than the land of Canaan; and his going thither only to sojourn, and with an intention to return again to Canaan, shows the strength of his faith in the promise; and so far was he from going back to his own country, from whence he came, that he went directly the contrary, for Chaldee lay north east of Canaan, and Egypt south west: this country is in the Hebrew text called Mizraim, from the second son of Ham, see Genesis 10:6   it had its name Egypt not from Aegyptus, one of its kings, as someF12Apollodorus, l. 2. in initio.  say, but from the blackish colour of its soil, and also of its river Nile, and of its inhabitants; which colour is by the Greeks called &quot;aegyptios&quot;, from &quot;aegyps&quot;, a vulture, a bird of that colour: it is bounded on the south by the kingdom of Sennar, tributary to the king of Ethiopia, and the cataracts of the Nile; on the north by the Mediterranean sea; on the east by the Arabian Gulf, or Red sea, and the isthmus of Suez; and on the west by a region of Lybia, called MarmoricaF13Vid.

Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 16. p. 417. , that Abram came out of Chaldee into Canaan, now called Judea, and a grievous famine being there, and understanding there was plenty in Egypt, he readily went thither, partly to partake of their plenty, and partly to hear what the priests would say of the gods; and Alexander Polyhistor relates, from EupolemusF15Apud ib. c. 17. p. 418, 419. , that Abram removed from the place of his nativity, Camarine, called by some Urie, and settled in Phoenicia, where being a famine, he went with all his family into Egypt, and dwelt there. </p>

<p>The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh ,....

And these princes were the king's courtiers, who taking notice of Sarai, and admiring her beauty, praised her for it to the king, and recommended her to be taken into the number of his wives or concubines, they understanding that she was a single woman and the sister of Abram: and this they did to gratify their king, and gain his favour: </p>
<p> and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house ; or palace, as the Jerusalem Targum; his royal palace, as the Targum of Jonathan; very probably into that part of his palace where his women were kept, or to some apartment where she might be purified and prepared for him; and this requiring time, was the means of preserving her from the danger she was exposed unto, see Esther 2:8 . The kingdom of Egypt, according to the Jewish and Arabic writersF21Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 76. 1. Elmacinus, p. 29. apud Hottinger. Smegma, p. 274. , was set up in the times of Reu, about three hundred years before Abram was here; its first king was Mizraim, a son of Ham, the same with the Menes of Herodotus; by whom also mention is made of a king of Egypt, whose name was PheronF23Euterpe sive, l. 2. c. 111. , which seems to bear some likeness to the name of this king, who by ArtapanusF24Apud Euseb. ut supra. (Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 16. p. 417.)  is called Pharethone, and whom, he says, Abram taught astrology. It is generally thought that Pharaoh was a common name to the kings of Egypt, and continued to be so to the times of Ezekiel, as Ptolemy was some time after, and as Caesar with the Romans: whether this king was the first of the name is not certain, but probable; according to someF25Vid. Rollin's Ancient History, vol. 1. p. 68. , he was one of the Hycsi, or shepherd kings. Mr. BedfordF26Scripture Chronology, p. 314.  calls him Janias, their fifth king, and this was about A. M. 2084, and before Christ 1920. A Jewish chronologerF1Juchasin, fol. 135. 1.  asserts, he was the first Pharaoh, who was in the times of Abram, and that his name was Totis, or Tutis, as the Arabic writersF2In the Universal History, vol. 2. p. 115. , one of whichF3Abulpharag. Hist. Dynast. p. 19.  says, that in the times of Serug lived Apiphanus king of Egypt (the same with Apophis; who according to Bishop UsherF4Annal Vet. Test. p. 7.  was this Pharaoh); after him was Pharaoh, the son of Sancs, from whom they (the kings of Egypt) were called Pharaohs. The name of Pharaoh is derived by someF5Malvenda, Ainsworth, &c.  from &#1508;&#1512;&#1506; , which signifies both to be free, and to revenge; and so kings were called, because free from laws themselves, and were revengers of them that do evil: but it rather seems to come from the Arabic wordF6&quot;in summo fuit, summumque cepit vel tenuit&quot;, Golius, col. 1787. Castel. col. 3077. , which signifies to be above others, and rule over them; and so may be thought to be not the proper name of a man, but an appellative, or the name of an office; or in other words, a king, see Genesis 41:44   and so it may be always rendered, where it is used, as here, the king's courtiers saw her, and commended her to the king, and she was taken into the king's house; though to this may be objected, that Pharaoh is sometimes called Pharaoh king of Egypt, and then there would be a tautology; wherefore it may be better perhaps to take it in the former sense. </p>

The Jews sayF7Pirke Eliezer, c. 26. , that Pharaoh, because of the love he had to Sarai, gave to her by writing all his substance, whether silver or gold, or servants or farms, and also the land of Goshen for an inheritance; and therefore the children of Israel dwelt in the land of Goshen, because it was Sarai our mother's, say they. </p>

(sect. 41. fol. 35. 4.) ; but &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;   signifies not a word only, but thing, matter and business: and so Onkelos renders it here: and the sense is, that Pharaoh and his courtiers were smitten, because of the affair and business of Sarai; because she was taken by them, and detained in Pharaoh's house, and designed to be made his wife or concubine; and thus for evil intentions was this punishment inflicted; so that evil designs, not brought into execution, are punishable; though the word of Sarai may mean what she was bid to say, and did. </p>

<p> why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ? when he first took her into his house, and no doubt Abram was present then, and very often afterwards was in company with Pharaoh, and conversed with him, having respect for him for the sake of Sarai, he took to be his sister, and yet would never tell him she was his wife. </p>

He could not imagine what could be the reason of it, what could induce him to give out such a story as this; for he knew not the fears that Abram was possessed with, which led him to it, and which might be in a good measure groundless, or else Pharaoh might have guessed at the reason; or this he said as being willing to be satisfied of the true one: </p>
<p> so I might have taken her to me to wife ; ignorantly, and without any scruple, supposing her to have been free; and so should have been guilty of taking another man's wife, and of depriving him of her; which with him were crimes he did not choose to commit, though polygamy was not accounted any by him, for no doubt he had a wife or wives when about to take Sarai for one: </p>
<p> now therefore, behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way ; Sarai it seems was present at this interview, who was delivered to her husband untouched, as his own property, and is ordered to depart the country, that so neither the king, nor any of his courtiers or subjects, might be under any temptation to do him an injury, by violating the chastity of his wife. The whole of this affair is related by EupolemusF12Apud Euseb. ut supra. (Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 18. p. 420.) , an Heathen historian, in a few words, in great agreement with this account; only he represents Sarai as married to the king of Egypt; he says, that Abram, on account of a famine, went to Egypt, with all his family, and there dwelt, and that the king of the Egyptians married his wife, he saying she was his sister: he goes on to relate more at large, says Alexander Polyhistor that quotes him, that the king could not enjoy her, and that his people and family were infected with a plague, upon which he called his diviners or prophets together, who told him that the woman was not a widow; and when the king of the Egyptians so understood it, that she was the wife of Abram, he restored her to her husband. </p>

<p>And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him ,.... His courtiers and servants, not to do him any hurt or injury in his person or substance; who he might suppose would be enraged at hearing how the king and they had been imposed upon and deceived; he ordered a guard about him while he was there, and to conduct him, and all that belonged to him, safely out of his dominions, as appears by what follows: but Dr. LightfootF13See his Works, vol. 1. p. 694.  is of opinion, that he gave charge to the Egyptians, making it as it were a law for the time to come, that they should not converse with Hebrews, nor with foreign shepherds, in any so near familiarity, as to eat or drink with them, which the Egyptians observed strictly ever after, Genesis 43:32 . </p>
<p> and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had ; they did not drive him out by force, or in any disgraceful manner, but being committed to a guard of men, appointed by the king, he had safe conduct out of the land, with his family, and all that he had; all that he brought with him, and all the increase he had made there, and all the gifts he had received of the king. The JewsF14Pirke Eliezer, c. 26.  interpret it of the writings and gifts he had given to Sarai; and theyF15Bereshit Rabba, sect. 40. fol. 35. 3.  observe a great likeness between Abram's descent into Egypt, his being there, and departure out of it, and that of his posterity in later times; as that they both went thither on account of a famine; that they both went down to sojourn there; and that they both went out with great substance; with other particulars observed by them. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 13  </p>
<p> This chapter gives an account of the return of Abram from Egypt to the land of Canaan, and to the same place in it he had been before, Genesis 13:1   and of a strife between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot, and the occasion of it, Genesis 13:5   which was composed by the prudent proposal of Abram, Genesis 13:8   upon which they parted; Abram continued in Canaan, and Lot chose the plain of Jordan, and dwelt near Sodom, a place infamous for wickedness, Genesis 13:10   after which the Lord renewed to Abram the grant of the land of Canaan to him, and to his seed, Genesis 13:14   and then he removed to the plain of Mamre in Hebron, and there set up the worship of God, Genesis 13:18 . </p>

<p>And Abram went up out of Egypt ,.... That country lying low, and so more easy to be watered by the river Nile, as it was, and Canaan being higher; whither he went, but not till the famine in Canaan ceased: he went out of Egypt, as the JewishF16Seder Olam Rabba, p. 2.  chronologers say, after he had been there three months; but ArtapanusF17Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 9. c. 18. p. 420.  an Heathen writer, says, he stayed there twenty years: </p>
<p> he and his wife, and all that he had ; servants and cattle: </p>
<p> and Lot with him : from whence it is clear that he went down with him into Egypt, and it is highly probable had great respect and favour shown him on account of his relation to Abram and Sarai; for it appears by what follows, that he was become very rich: and they all went up </p>
<p> into the south ; into the southern part of the land of Canaan, for otherwise they came to the north; for as Egypt lay south with respect to Canaan, Canaan was north from Egypt; but they journeyed to that part of that land which was commonly called the south, either Negeb, as here, or Daroma; See Gill on Zechariah 7:7 . </p>

<p>And Abram was very rich ,.... He was rich in spiritual things, in faith, and in all other graces, and was an heir of the kingdom of heaven; and in temporal things, as it sometimes is the lot of good men to be, though but rarely, at least to be exceeding rich, as Abram was; or &quot;very heavy&quot;F18&#1499;&#1489;&#1491;  &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;   &quot;gravis valde&quot;, Montanus, Vatablus, Drusius, Schmidt. , as the word signifies, he was loaded with wealth and riches, and sometimes an abundance of riches are a burden to a man, and, instead of making him more easy, create him more trouble; and, as we may observe presently, were the occasion of much trouble to Abram and Lot. Abram's riches lay </p>
<p> in cattle, in silver, and in gold ; cattle are mentioned first, as being the principal part of the riches of men in those days, such as sheep and oxen, he and she asses and camels, see Genesis 12:16   and besides these he had great quantities of silver and gold: the Jews sayF19Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 2. 1.  he coined money in his own name, and that his coin had on one side an old man and an old woman, and on the other side a young man and a young woman. His riches no doubt were greatly increased by the gifts and presents he received from the king of Egypt during his stay there. </p>

<p>And he went on in his journeys from the south ,.... He took the same tour, went the same road, stopping at the same resting places, as when he went down to Egypt; having learned, as Jarchi observes, the way of the earth, that a man should not change his host. Though some, as Ben Gersom, understand it of his taking his journeys as were suitable for his cattle, as they were able to bear them, and not overdrive them, lest he should kill them, but made short stages, and frequently stopped and rested. And thus he went on through the southern part of the land, until he came </p>
<p> even to Bethel ; as it was afterwards called, though now Luz, Genesis 28:19 . </p>
<p> unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning ; when he first came into the land of Canaan, to a mountain </p>
<p> between Bethel and Hai ; afterwards called Mount Ephraim, and was four miles from Jerusalem on the northF20Bunting's Travels, &c. p. 59. ; see Genesis 12:8 . </p>

<p>Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first ,.... When he first came to that place, and before he went down to Egypt: it is not said he came to the altar, but &quot;to the place&quot;, where it had stood, for it seems now to have been demolished, either having fallen of itself, being made of earth, or had been destroyed by the Canaanites, since Abram left it; or perhaps it might be pulled down by Abram himself before he went from thence, that it might not be used and polluted by the idolatrous Canaanites. </p>
<p> And there Abram called on the name of the Lord ; prayed unto him, and gave him thanks for the preservation of him and his wife in Egypt; for the support of himself and his family there during the famine in Canaan; for the increase of his worldly substance, and for the protection of him, and all that belonged to him, in his journey from Egypt thither; and for all the instances of his grace, and the rich experiences of his goodness he had favoured him with; See Gill on Genesis 12:8   where the same form of expression is used. </p>

<p>And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together ,.... That part of the country where Abram and Lot were could not afford them room enough for their several tents; or however could not furnish them with sufficient pasturage for their flocks and herds, they were so numerous; at least could not do it so as to be contiguous to each other, that there was a necessity of one of them going further off: </p>
<p> for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together ; we have before an account of the substance of each of them, how great it was; and here now is noted an inconvenience which arises from a large increase of riches, that relations and friends are obliged to part, and cannot dwell together; what one would think would make them more comfortable together, is the cause and occasion of their separation. </p>

<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 13:7" display="now" /><b>Gen 13:7</b></p>


<p>And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle ,.... Not between the two masters, but between their servants, their upper servants, that had the care of their herds to feed them, and water them; and it is very probable their strife was about pasturage and watering places, the one endeavouring to get them from the other, or to get the best; which is much more likely than what Jarchi suggests, that the herdmen of Lot were wicked men, and fed their cattle in the fields of others, and the herdmen of Abram reproved them for their robbery; but they said, the land is given of Abram, and he hath no heir, but Lot is his heir, and what robbery is this? and to this sense are the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem: </p>
<p> and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land ; which observation is made by Moses to point to a reason why they could not both of them have a sufficiency for their large flocks and herds, because the country was in the possession of others; and though there was to spare, yet not enough for them both. The Canaanite, though it was a general name for the people of the whole land, yet was given to a particular family in it, and was derived from their first founder Canaan, the son of Ham; the Perizzite was another family or tribe of the same nation, who had their name from &#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1494; , &quot;a village&quot;; these being Pagans or villagers, living in huts, or houses, or tents scattered up and down in the fields, and were a rough, inhuman, and unsociable sort of people, and therefore it could not be expected that they would oblige them with much pasturage and water for their flocks: and besides, this may be remarked, partly to show the danger that Abram and Lot were in through the dissension of their herdmen, since those people that were so nigh might take the advantage of their quarrels among themselves, and fall upon them both, and destroy them, and therefore a reconciliation was necessary; and partly to observe the reproach that was like to come upon them, and upon the true religion, for their sakes, should they differ among themselves, which such sort of men would gladly catch at, and improve against them. </p>

<p>And Abram said unto Lot ,.... Being either an ear witness himself of the contentions of their servants, or having it reported to him by credible persons, he applied himself to Lot, in order to make peace, being a wise and good man; and though he was senior in years, and superior in substance, and higher in the class of relation, and upon all accounts the greatest man, yet he makes the proposal first, and lays a scheme before Lot for their future friendship, and to prevent quarrels, and the mischievous consequences of them: </p>
<p> let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee ; there had been none yet, but it was very likely there would, if the dissension should go on between their servants; they could not well avoid interesting themselves in it, when it related to their respective properties; and there must be a right and wrong in such cases to be looked into and adjusted, which might occasion a difference between them; and this Abram was desirous of preventing, and therefore bespeaks his kinsman in this loving, affectionate, and condescending language: </p>
<p> and or between my herdmen and thy herdmen ; as he understood there was, and which, if not timely put an end to, might be of bad consequence to them both, especially as to their peace and comfort, giving this excellent reason to enforce his request: </p>
<p> for we be brethren ; or &quot;men brethren we be&quot;F21&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501;  &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;  &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;   &quot;viri fratres vos&quot;, Pagninus Montanus, Drusius, Schmidt. ; we are men, let us act like such, the rational and humane part; they were brethren being men, so by nature all are brethren; by natural relation, Lot being the son of his brother Haran; brethren in religion, of the same faith in the one true and living God, and worshippers of him; and therefore on all accounts, by the ties of nature, relation, and religion, they were obliged to seek and cultivate peace and love. </p>

<p>Is not the whole land before thee ?.... Signifying, that though there were not room and convenience for them both in that part of the country in which they were, yet there were in other parts; and though the land was given to Abram, he did not desire Lot to depart out of it; nay, he sets it all before him to choose what part he would dwell in, which was great condescension in him: </p>
<p> separate thyself, I pray thee, from me ; not that he was weary of his company and fellowship with him, but, as things were circumstanced, a separation was necessary for the subsistence of their herds and flocks, and for the peace and comfort of their respective families; nor did he desire him to go out of the land, or be so far from him, that he could be of no advantage to him; but though separate, yet so near him as to give him help and assistance, as there might be occasion for it, and as there was some time after, which appears from the history of the following chapter. </p>
<p> If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left ; or as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan are,&quot;if thou wilt go to the north, I will go to the south, or if thou wilt go to the south, I will go to the north:'for when a man stands with his face to the east, the principal part, the north is on his left hand, and the south on his right; and this was an usual way of speaking in the eastern countries; but they were not, as Grotius observes, Aristotelians, who make the east the right hand, and the west the left. This was an instance of the peaceable disposition of Abram, and of his humility and condescension to give his nephew leave, who was in all respects inferior to him, to make his choice, to go which way he would, and take what part of the country he pleased. </p>

<p>And Lot lifted up his eyes ,.... He immediately fell in with Abram's proposal, but had not the ingenuity to return back the choice to Abram which he gave him, but took the advantage of it; nor did he show any uneasiness or unwillingness to part from Abram, though so near a relation, and so wise and good a man, and by whose means greatly he had obtained his riches; but without giving himself any concern about this, he at once cast about in his mind where to make his choice; he considered within himself which was the best part of the country, and most convenient for his flocks and herds, and where he was most likely to increase his substance; for this phrase chiefly has respect to the eyes of the understanding, he made use of, consulted with himself with his rational powers what was fittest to be done; unless we can suppose him situated on some considerable eminence, from whence he could have a view of the whole country he made choice of, as follows: </p>
<p> and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where ; a large plain, full of rich pasturage, which had its name from the river Jordan, which by various windings and turnings ran through it, and which at harvest time overflowed its banks, and greatly contributed to the richness of the soil: </p>
<p> before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah : as he afterwards did by fire from heaven, and then that part of the plain on which those cities stood was turned into a sulphurous lake: </p>
<p> even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt ; as any most excellent garden that is full of plants and trees, well watered, and well cultivated, and taken care of; as things most excellent are sometimes expressed by having the name of God, or the Lord, added to them, as the &quot;cedars of God&quot;, &c. or as the garden of Eden, which was planted by the Lord, abounding with all kind of trees, and was well watered by a river running through it: and some think that the plain of Jordan, and the parts thereabout, were the real garden of Eden; wherefore one learnedF23Nic. Abram. Pharus Ver. Test. p. 59.  man takes the &quot;as&quot; here not to be a note of similitude, but of reality, and not merely comparative but causal, giving a reason why it was so watered, being the garden God; so that the plain was not like unto, but really was the garden of Eden: and another observesF24Texelii Phoenix, l. 3. c. 7. p. 262. , that the words should be rendered, &quot;so was the garden of the Lord, as the land of Egypt&quot;, and that the repetition of the similitude only makes one comparison, and not two; not that the plain of Jordan is first compared with the garden of the Lord, and then with the land of Egypt; but the plain of Jordan, or garden of the Lord, is only compared with the land of Egypt; and with that undoubtedly it is compared, it being once a year overflowed by the river Jordan, as the land of Egypt was with the Nile, and was a most delightful and fruitful spot like that: </p>
<p> as thou comest unto Zoar ; which is not to be connected with the land of Egypt, for Zoar was at a great distance from Egypt, but with the plain of Jordan, well watered everywhere till you come to Zoar, at the skirts of it, and which is by an anticipation called Zoar; for at this time, when Abram and Lot parted, it was called Bela, and afterwards, on another account, had the name of Zoar; see Genesis 14:2 . </p>

<p> and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre , or &quot;in the oaks of Mamre&quot;F5&#1489;&#1488;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;  &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;   &quot;juxta quercetum Mamre&quot;, Tigurine version, Pagninus, Montanus; so Ainsworth. ; in a grove of oaks there, as being shady and pleasant to dwell among or under, and not through any superstitious regard to such trees and places where they grew; which has obtained since among the Heathens, and particularly among the Druids, who have their name from thence. Indeed such superstitions might take their rise from hence, being improved and abused to such purposes; and both JeromF6De loc. Heb. fol. 87. E. tom. 3.  and SozomenF7Eccles. Hist. l. 2. c. 4. p. 447.  speak of the oak of Abram being there in the times of Constantine, and greatly resorted to, and had in great veneration; and they and others make mention of a turpentine tree, which it is pretended sprung from a walking stick of one of the angels that appeared to Abram at this place, greatly regarded in a superstitious way by all sorts of persons: this plain or grove of oaks, here spoken of, was called after a man whose name was Mamre, an Amorite, a friend and confederate of Abram: </p>

The place they call the Turpentine, from the tree that grows there, according to SozomenF8lbid. , was fifteen furlongs distant from Hebron to the south; but JosephusF9De Bello Jud. l. 5. c. 9. sect. 7.  says it was but six furlongs, or three quarters of a mile; who speaking of Hebron says,&quot;the inhabitants of it say, that it is not only more ancient than the cities of that country, but than Memphis in Egypt, and is reckoned to be of 2300 years standing: they report, that it was the habitation of Abram, the ancestor of the Jews, after he came out of Mesopotamia, and that from hence his children descended into Egypt, whose monuments are now shown in this little city, made of beautiful marble, and elegantly wrought; and there is shown, six furlongs from it, a large turpentine tree, which they say remained from the creation to that time.'A certain travellerF10Baumgarten.

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 14  </p>
<p> This chapter gives an account of a war that was waged, and a battle fought between four kings on one side, and five on the other, and of the occasion and issue of it, who were the first kings, and this the first battle the Scriptures speak of, Genesis 14:1 ; Lot and his goods being taken and carried off, with those of Sodom, by the conquerors, Abram hearing of it armed his men, and pursued after them, and overtook and overcame them, and rescued Lot and his goods, with others, and returned, Genesis 14:12 ; when he was met by the kings of Sodom and Salem, who congratulated him on his victory, Genesis 14:17 ; and what passed between him, and those great personages, is related, Genesis 14:20 . </p>

<p>And it came to pass, in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar ,.... Or Babylon, as Onkelos, where Nimrod began his kingdom, Genesis 10:8 . This was Nimrod himself, as the Jewish writers generally says; though more likely Ninyas the son of Ninus and Semiramis, and grandson of Nimrod; or rather some petty prince or deputy governor of Shinar, under the king of Babylon; since, though named first, he was not the principal in this war, but fought under the king of Elam, and as an ally and auxiliary of his; and it may be the kingdom of Babylon was not as yet of any great extent and power, and that all those stories told of Ninus, Semiramis, and Ninyas, are mere fables; and indeed we hear nothing in Scripture of this kingdom, and the kings of it, from this time, until the times of Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan king of Babylon, in the reign of Hezekiah king of Judah; nor of the Assyrian kingdom, and the kings of it, until Pul king of Assyria, in the times of Menahem king of Israel; wherefore it is greatly to be questioned, whether those kingdoms rose to any considerable height until these times: though some think that Shinar here does not intend Shinar in Chaldea or Babylon, which was too far distant from Abram, but Shinar in Mesopotamia, a large city at the foot of a mountain, three days distant from Mansil, which is now, in Arabic, called Singjar, and by Ptolemy, SingaraF14Hyde Hist. Relig. Pers. c. 2. p. 46. . </p>
<p> Arioch king of Ellasar ; or Telassar, according to the Targum of Jonathan, a place in Mesopotamia, inhabited by the children of Eden, Isaiah 37:12 ; and StephanusF15De Urbibus.  makes mention of a city in Coelesyria, upon the borders of Arabia, called Ellas, of which this prince may be thought to be the governor; or rather he was king of a people called Elesari, whose country is placed by PtolemyF16Geograph. l. 6. c. 7.  in Arabia; and could Ninyas be thought to be Amraphel, this king would bid fair to be Ariaeus a king of Arabia, or a son of his of the same name, that was a confederate of Ninus, as Diodorus SiculusF17Bibliothec. l. 2. p. 90.  relates out of Ctesias. Next follows: </p>
<p> Chedorlaomer king of Elam ; or the Elamites, as the Vulgate Latin version, the Persians, see Acts 1:9 . This led DiodorusF18Apud Drusium in loc.  to say, that the war Moses speaks of is what the Persians waged against the Sodomites. This seems to have been the most powerful prince at this time, to whom the five kings of Sodom, &c. had been subject for twelve years, but now had rebelled, and to subdue them again he came forth, with three other kings his allies, see Genesis 14:4 ; but if Elam is the same with Persia, as it often signifies, or with Elymais, a part of Persia, that kingdom could not be at this time so large and potent as it has been since; or Chedorlaomer would not have stood in need of the assistance of other princes against such petty kings as those of Sodom, &c. Nor does it seem credible that he should come out of Persia, and pass through so great a part of the world as the countries of Assyria, Chaldea, Mesopotamia, Syria, and part of Arabia and of Canaan, to bring five such small towns or cities into subjection to him, as he must, as Sir Walter RaleighF19History of the World, par. 1. B. 2. c. 1. sect. 13. p. 138.  observes; nor could the trifle of goods, as they may be comparatively called, he carried off, be an equivalent to the expense he must be at in so long a march. It is more probable, therefore, that this was the name of some place near to the land of Canaan, built by some of the posterity of Elam, the son of Shem, and called after the name of their ancestor; or it may be a colony of the Elamites in those parts, of which this prince was their head and chief: </p>
<p> and Tidal king of nations ; that is, either of other nations distinct from those before mentioned, so Aben Ezra; or else, as he also observes, the name of a province; or as Jarchi and Ben Melech, the name of a place called Goim, because there were gathered together many out of various nations and places, and they set a man to reign over them, whose name was Tidal; just as one of the Galilees in later times was called Galilee of the nations, for a like reason. Sir Walter RaleighF20Ibid. sect. 11. p. 137.  conjectures, that as there were many petty kingdoms joining to Phoenicia and Palestine, as Palmyrene, Batanea, Laodicene, Apamene, Chalcidice, Cassiotis and Celibonitis, these might be gathered together under this man. According to EupolemusF21Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 17. p. 418. , an Heathen writer, these several princes were Armenians that fought with the Phoenicians, and overcame them, by whom Lot was carried captive. JosephusF23Antiqu. l. 1. c. 9.  indeed, accommodating himself to the Greek historians, and in favour of them, says that the Assyrians at this time were masters of Asia, and led out an army under four generals, and made the kings of Sodom, &c. tributary to them; and they rebelling against them, made another expedition upon them under these four kings as their generals, and conquered them: but it seems not likely that the Assyrian monarchy was so large at this time; or if it was, these live petty kings of the plain of Jordan, who had not so much ground as our Middlesex, as Sir Walter RaleighF24Ut supra, (History of the World, par. 1. B. 2. c. 1.) sect. 10. p. 136.  observes, and perhaps not a quarter of the people in it, would never have dared to have engaged with so powerful an adversary. </p>

<p>That these made war with Bera king of Sodom ,.... A city in the plain of Jordan, which with the four following made the Pentapolis, or five cities of the plain. StraboF25Geograph. l. 16. p. 526.  says, in this place formerly were thirteen cities, the metropolis of which was Sodom, and which yet had remaining a compass of sixty furlongs; according to Dr. LightfootF26Works, vol. 2. p. 6. Vid. Reland. Palestina illustrata, tom. 2. p. 1020. , it should be placed in the southern extremity of the lake Asphaltites, whereas it is usually set in the maps in the northern bounds of it: </p>

<p> Shinab king of Admah ; a third city situated in the same plain: </p>
<p> and Shemeber king of Zeboiim ; a fourth city of the plain, which seems to have its name from the pleasantness of its situation: </p>
<p> and the king of Bela, which is Zoar ; so it was afterwards called by Lot, being a little city, Genesis 19:20 ; but before, Bela; the name of its king is not mentioned, being a person of no great note and importance, and his city small. </p>

Now the above five kings, as they all dwelt in the plain, they entered into a confederacy, met together, and joined their forces in this vale, to oppose the four kings that were come to make war with them, as being an advantageous place, as they judged, perhaps on more accounts than one; and here they stayed to receive the enemy, and give him battle, see Genesis 14:8 , </p>
<p> which is the salt sea ; afterwards so called, not at this time, for then it would not have been fit for armies to be drawn up in battle array in it; but it was so called in the times of Moses, and after this fine vale was turned into a bituminous lake, and had its name from the saltness of the waters of the lake, or from the city Melach, or city of salt, which was near it, Joshua 15:62 . </p>

<p>Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer ,.... King of Elam, who was of the race of Shem, and so the prophecy of Noah began to be fulfilled, that Canaan should be servant to Shem, Genesis 9:26 ; for the kings of Sodom, &c. and their subjects, were of the race of Ham in the line of Canaan, who had by violence seized on that part of the earth which was allotted to the sons of Shem, and therefore Chedorlaomer being a descendant of his claimed his right, and made them tributary to him, which they were for the space of twelve years: </p>

<p> and the kings that were with him ; those kings before mentioned: </p>
<p> and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim ; which were in their way to Sodom, &c. and very probably were confederates with the five kings; the Targum, and so the Septuagint, render the word &quot;giants&quot;, as it is in Deuteronomy 2:11 ; but they were one of the nations or tribes of the Canaanites, Genesis 15:20 ; and had their name either from the Hebrew word &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; , which signifies to be healthful and robust, as those people might be, or from Rephas, the Remphan of Stephen, Acts 7:43 ; called Chiun, Amos 5:26 ; and with Cronus or Ham the father of Canaan, as Bishop CumberlandF3Sanchoniatho's Phoenician History, p. 220, 221.  observes; and these dwelt in Ashteroth Karnaim, which was a place in Bashan, Deuteronomy 1:4 ; it is about six miles, as EusebiusF4Apud Reland. Palest. illustrata, tom. 2. p. 5. 98.  says, from Adraa or Edrei, and in the Apocrypha:&quot;Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the temple of Atargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons.' (2 Maccabees 12:26)mention is made of a place called Carnion, where was a temple of Atergates, a Phoenician deity, as Ashteroth or Astarte, was; and this city here had its first name from Astarte the wife of Cronus or Ham, and whose name may be preserved in Carnaim, as Bishop Cumberland thinks; though as Astarte is said by SanchoniathoF5Sanchoniatho's Phoenician History, p. 35.  to put on her head the mark of her sovereignty, a bull's head, that is, with its horns, this might be another of her names retained in this city; and it is certain that she was a Phoenician goddess, called the goddess of the Zidonians, 1 Kings 11:5 ; and Sanchoniatho relatesF6Ibid. p. 36. , that the Phoenicians say, that Astarte is she, who among the Greeks is called Aphrodite or Venus; and Astarte is called by LucianF7De Dea Syria.  the Phoenician Venus, and by CiceroF8De Natura Deorum, l. 3.  the Syrian Venus; and if she was the same with Diana or the moon, as some think, she might have the name of Carnaim from its two horns, as the word signifies: our English poetF9------------with these in troop Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd Astarte queen of heav'n, with crescent horns. --Milton's Paradise Lost, B. 1. l. 437, 438, 439.  seems to have this in his thoughts, when he speaks of Astoreth as the goddess of the Phoenicians: however the in habitants of this place who belonged to the Canaanites were first attacked by the four kings and routed, though not utterly destroyed, because we hear of them afterwards, as well as they that follow: </p>
<p> and the Zuzims in Ham ; or Hemtha, as Onkelos and Jonathan render it, a place so called from Ham the father of Canaan, and was somewhere in the land of Canaan or near it, and near the former place; for it can hardly be thought the land of Egypt, sometimes called the land of Ham, is meant; these Zuzim are supposed by Jarchi to the same with the Zamzummim in Deuteronomy 2:20 ; the word is by Onkelos and Jonathan rendered strong and mighty ones, as also by the Septuagint, mighty nations: </p>
<p> and the Enims in Shaveh Kiriathaim : a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim, and were accounted giants as they, and who in later times were by the Moabites called Emim, Deuteronomy 2:10 ; and therefore Moses gives them the same name here, which they had from the dread and terror they injected into men, and so the word in all the three Targums is rendered terrible ones; and these dwelt in Kiriathaim, a city in the tribe of Reuben, taken from Sihon, king of the Amorites, and which seems to be situated in a plain, see Joshua 13:19 . </p>

<p>And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh ,.... Pursuing their victories as far as Elparan by the wilderness, they had passed by the country of the Amalekites; wherefore they &quot;returned&quot;, or came back to fall upon them, and they came to a place called Enmishpat, or the &quot;fountain of judgment&quot;; which was not its future name, as Jarchi thinks, because there Moses and Aaron were to be judged concerning the business of that fountain, even the waters of Meribah, with which agrees the Targum of Jonathan;&quot;and they returned and came to the place where the judgment of Moses the prophet was determined by the fountain of the waters of contention:'but it seems to have been the ancient name of the place, and by which it was called at this time, as Kadesh was the name of it at the time of Moses writing this; and therefore he adds: </p>
<p> which is Kadesh ; that is, which is now called Kadesh, because there the Lord was sanctified, when the rock at that place was smitten, and waters gushed out: it was a city on the uttermost border of the land of Edom, Numbers 20:1 , and seems formerly to have been a place where causes were heard and judgment passed; and so Onkelos paraphrases it,&quot;to the plain of the division or decision of judgment;'which, as Jarchi himself interprets it,&quot;is a place where the men of the province gathered together for all judgment;'or for hearing all causes and determining them: </p>
<p> and smote all the country of the Amalekites ; which, according to JosephusF11Antiqu. l. 6. c. 7. sect. 3. , reached from Pelusium in Egypt to the Red sea; they inhabited Arabia Petraea, for heF12lbid. l. 3. c. 2. sect. 1.  says, the inhabitants of Gobolitis and Petra are called Amalekites; which name is generally supposed to have been given them here by way of anticipation, since the commonly received opinion is, that they were the descendants of Amalek, a grandson of Esau, who was not born when this war was waged, see Genesis 36:12 ; but the Mahometan writers derive the pedigree of Amalek, from whom these people had their name, from Noah in the line of Ham, and make him to be some generations older than Abram, which with them stands thus, Noah, Ham, Aram, Uz, Ad, AmalekF13Taarich, M. S. apud Reland. Palestina illustrata, tom. 1. p. 81. ; and they speak of the Amalekites as dwelling in the country about Mecca, from whence they were driven by the JorhamitesF14Alkodaius, apud Pocock. Specimen Arab. Hist. p. 173. : and indeed it seems more probable that the Amalekites were of the posterity of Ham, since Chedorlaomer, a descendant of Shem, falls upon them, and smites them; and they being confederates with the Canaanites, and are with the Amorites, Philistines, and other Canaanitish nations, always mentioned, seem to be a more ancient nation than what could proceed from Amalek the son of Eliphaz, since Amalek is said to be the first of the nations, Numbers 24:20 ; nor does there ever appear to be any harmony and friendship between them and the Edomites, as it might be thought there would, if they were a branch of Esau's family; nor did they give them any assistance, when destroyed by Saul, so that they seem rather to be a tribe of the Canaanitish nations; and they are, by PhiloF15De Vita Mosis, l. 1. p. 636.  the Jew, expressly called Phoenicians: </p>
<p> and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar ; the same with the Emorites, see Genesis 10:16 ; another tribe or nation of the Canaanites descended from Amor or Emor, a son of Canaan: the place of their habitation has its name of Hazezontamar from the multitude of palm trees which grew there: for Tamar signifies a palm tree, and Hazezon is from &#1495;&#1510;&#1509;   &quot;to cut&quot;; and this part of the name seems to be taken from the cutting of the top, crown, or head of the palm tree, for the sake of a liquor which has a more luscious sweetness than honey; and is of the consistence of a thin syrup, as Dr. ShawF16Travels, tom. 1. p. 143. Ed. 2.  relates; the head of the palm tree being cut off, the top of the trunk is scooped into the shape of a basin, as he says, where the sap in ascending lodges itself at the rate of three or four quarts a day during the first week or fortnight, after which the quantity daily diminishes; and at the end of six weeks or two months the juices are entirely consumed, and the tree becomes dry, and serves only for timber or, firewood. This place is the same with Engedi, 2 Chronicles 20:2 ; and so the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan here translate it, &quot;in Engedi&quot;; and which place PlinyF17Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 17.  says was famous for groves of palm trees; it was a city near the Dead sea, see Ezekiel 47:8 ; and Josephus saysF18Antiqu. l. 9. c. 1. sect. 2.  it was situated by the lake Asphaltites, that is, the place where Sodom and Gomorrah stood; and he adds, that it was three hundred furlongs distant from Jerusalem, where were the best palm trees and balsam: so that now the four kings had got pretty near Sodom; wherefore it follows, </p>

BrocardusF20Apud Adricom. Theatrum Terrae Sanct. p. 44.  says, these pits or wells of bitumen are at this day on the shore of the lake, each of them having pyramids erect, which he saw with his own eyes; and such pits casting out bitumen, as fountains do water, have been found in other countries, as in GreeceF21Aelian. Var. Hist. l. 13. c. 16. . Now this vale being full of such pits, the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah chose it to fight in, and here drew up in a line of battle, hoping that the enemy, being ignorant of them, would fall into them and perish, and their ranks be broke and fall into confusion; but as it often is, that the pit men dig and contrive for others they fall into themselves, so it was in this case: </p>
<p> and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled : the battle going hard against them, and they not able to stand before their enemies: </p>

<p> and they that remained fled to the mountain : or mountains hard by, where Lot after went when Sodom was destroyed, Genesis 19:30 ; hither such fled that escaped the sword of the enemy, or perished not in the slimepits, judging it more safe to be there, than to be in their cities, which would fall into the hands of their enemies, and be plundered by them, and where they would be in danger of losing their lives. </p>

<p> who dwelt in Sodom , or near it, in the country adjacent to it, see Genesis 13:12 ; and so being a neighbour of the men of Sodom, and a sojourner among them, he partakes of their punishment; and this was a just correction of him for choosing to dwell among such a people: and they took </p>
<p> his goods, and departed ; as him and his family, so all his substance, his cattle, wealth, and riches of every sort, and went off with it: EupolemusF25Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 9. c. 17. p. 418. , an Heathen writer, makes mention of this circumstance in his relation of this war, and says, that the Armenians, as he calls the four kings, baring conquered the Phoenicians, carried away captive the brother's son of Abram. </p>

<p>And there came one that escaped ,.... Both the sword of the enemy and the slimepits; either one of the inhabitants of Sodom, who had an acquaintance with Lot and a friendship for him, and knew his relation to Abram; or one of Lot's family, that might escape being taken and carried captive: for not Michael the prince, so called, because when the angels fell they would have drawn him with them, but God delivered him, and therefore his name was called &#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496; , or &quot;one that escaped&quot;, as the JewsF26Pirke Eliezer, c. 27.  say; nor Og, that escaped the waters of the flood, as they also sayF1Targum Jon. & Jarchi in loc. Bereshit Rabba, sect. 42. fol. 37. 2. T. Bab. Niddah, fol. 61. 1. , and now from this war, and was the only one left of the Rephaim, or giants, whom Amraphel slew, which they gather from Deuteronomy 3:11 ; who they suppose came with the following message to Abram with an ill design, that he might go out to war with the kings, and be slain, and then he thought to marry his wife; but these are idle fancies, what is first suggested is right. </p>
<p> And told Abram the Hebrew ; that there had been a battle of four kings with five, that the latter were beaten, among whom were the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah; and that Lot, his kinsman, who dwelt in or near Sodom, was carried captive, with all his goods. Abram is called the Hebrew, either from his passing over or coming beyond the river Euphrates, from Chaldea into Canaan; with which the Septuagint version agrees, rendering it the &quot;passer over&quot;; and so Jarchi says he is called, because he came beyond the river: or rather from his having lived beyond it, as such as dwelt there were called; for it can hardly be thought that he should peculiarly have this name from that single action of his passing the river, which multitudes did besides him: but rather, why should he not be called Ibri, the word here used, from the place of his birth? For, according to the TalmudistsF2T. Bab. Bava Bathra, fol. 91. 1. & Gloss. in ib. , Ur of the Chaldees was called &#1506;&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;  &#1494;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; , &quot;little Ibra&quot;; though it is more generally thought he had this name from his being a descendant of Eber, and who was not only of his sons' sons, and spoke the same language, but professed the same religion, and which was continued in his posterity, who to the latest ages were called Hebrews, and sometimes Eber, Numbers 24:24 ; and which is the opinion of many Jewish writersF3Bereshit Rabba, sect. 42. fol. 37. 3. Sepher Cosri, par. 1. sect. 49. fol. 24. 2. Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 75. 1. Aben Ezra on Exod. i. 16. , and seems most probable: </p>
<p> for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite ; see Genesis 13:18 ; it was about forty miles from Sodom, but from it to Dan, whither he pursued the four kings, and where he overtook, fought, and smote them, is by some computed one hundred and twenty four milesF4Bunting's Travels, p. 57. : this Mamre, from whom the plain or grove of oaks were called, was the </p>
<p> brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner ; who are particularly mentioned, because of their concern in the following expedition: </p>
<p> and these were confederate with Abram ; or &quot;were masters&quot; or &quot;authors of a covenant&quot;F5&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;  &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; , &quot;Domini vel antores foederis&quot;, Piscator, Oleaster.  with him; they had entered into a league to defend one another, their persons and properties, from the insults of invaders and tyrants, or thieves and robbers: and it may be lawful to form such leagues with irreligious persons on such accounts, where there is no prohibition from God, as there was none as yet, though there afterwards was one; and the Israelites, were forbid to make covenants with the Canaanites, but that was after they were drove out of the land for their sins, Deuteronomy 7:1 ; besides, it is not improbable that these men were religious men, and worshipped the same God with Abram, for such there were among the Canaanitish princes, of which Melchizedek, after spoken of, is an instance; and as yet the sin of the Amorites was not full, of which tribe or nation these men were. </p>

<p>And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive ,.... That is, his brother's son Lot, as in Genesis 14:12 ; which was contrary to the law of nations; since Lot was only a sojourner, and not an inhabitant n Sodom, and therefore had no concern in the quarrel between the kings, and this justified Abram's taking up arms on his behalf: </p>
<p> he armed his trained servants ; such as were trained up by him in religious exercises, see Genesis 18:19 ; in the affairs and business of civil life, in the care of flocks and herds, and particularly in the art of war; which was both lawful and necessary, for the preservation of his family and substance from oppressors: </p>
<p> born in his own house ; of his servants, and so were his property, and at his disposal and command; their number was </p>
<p> three hundred and eighteen , a large number for servants, and which showed how great a man Abram was, what possessions he must have to employ so many, and yet but a small number for an army, to go forth with against four kings who had conquered five; though how many his confederates brought with them is not certain: </p>
<p> and pursued them unto Dan ; the Jerusalem Targum is, to Dan of Caesarea, meaning Caesarea of Philippi, as in the times of Christ and his apostles it was called; which at first had the name of Leshem, or Lais, and was not called Dan until the times of the judges, Judges 18:29 ; wherefore, if the same place is intended here, it is so called not only by anticipation, but by a spirit of prophecy; since it had not the name of Dan even in the times of Moses, the writer of this history, unless it may be thought to be inserted by Samuel or some other inspired writer, after Moses; though there is no need to suppose either of these, seeing there might be a town or city of this name in those parts at this time, or however one of the springs of Jordan might be so called, from whence the river had its name as early, Genesis 13:11 ; and so JosephusF6Antiqu. l. 1. c. 10. sect. 1.  expressly says, speaking of this expedition, that Abram fell upon them at Dan, for so, adds he, the other fountain of Jordan is called. </p>

<p>And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night ,.... Together with his confederates; and very probably their whole three was divided into four parts, under their four leaders; and this might be done in order to attack the four kings and their soldiers, who might be in four separate bodies; or to fall upon their camp in the four quarters of it, and to make a show of a greater army, thereby to intimidate the enemy: Abram seems to have understood the art of war, and the use of stratagems in it; and, as it might be night before he could come up to them, he took the advantage of that, and fell upon them unawares, when some were asleep in their beds, and others drunk, as JosephusF7Antiqu. l. 1. c. 10. sect. 1.  relates; and who also says, it was on the fifth night after Abram had knowledge of what had happened at Sodom: </p>
<p> and smote them, and pursued them unto Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus ; a famous city in Syria; it was in later times the metropolis of that country, Isaiah 7:8 ; and was most delightfully situated in a vale; see Gill on Jeremiah 49:25 ; according to JosephusF8lbid. c. 6. sect. 4.  it was built by Uz, the son of Aram and grandson of Shem, and some sayF9Baumgarten. Peregrinatio, l. 3. c. 4. p. 111.  by Shem himself, and that it is to this day called Sem in the Saracene language, and lay between Palestine and Coelesyria; on the left hand of this city, or on the north of it, as all the Targums paraphrase it, lay a place called Hoba, and is completed to be eighty miles from Dan, from whence he pursued them hither, after he had discomfited them there. </p>

<p> at the valley of Shaveh ; a most plain and even valley, as the word signifies, clear of trees and everything that obstructs sight or passage, as Jarchi observes, and so a proper place to have an interview in: </p>

<p>And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine ,.... Both the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem say, this is Shem the son of Noah, and which is the sense of the Jewish writers in general, and of many Christian ones; but, though it is highly probable he was living at this time, yet it is not easy to account for it why his name should be changed, or that he should reign in a country in the possession of his brother's son; or that he should meet Abram, and congratulate him on the slaughter of one of his own descendants, as Chedorlaomer was; and especially it cannot be said of him that he was without father or mother, or that those were not known, since Shem's parentage and pedigree are famous enough; some have thought him to be more than a mere man, even the Son of God himself, but he is manifestly distinguished from him in Hebrews 7:3 ; he seems to be what JosephusF11De Bello Jud. l. 6. c. 10.  says he was, a Canaanitish prince, a pious and religious man, eminently raised up by God, and whose genealogy was kept a secret, that he might be in this as in other things a type of Christ; but that he should be Canaan himself, as Dr. ClaytonF12Chronology of the Hebrew Bible, p. 100.  thinks, a brother of Metsir, or Mizraim, the second son of Ham, being by Sanchoniatho called Sedec, is not likely, since he was cursed by Noah. Salem, of which he was king, is by the above Targums said to be Jerusalem, and which is the opinion of many writers, Jewish and Christian, and of which opinion I myself was formerly; see Gill on Hebrews 7:1 ; Jerusalem being plainly called Salem, Psalm 76:2 , but it seems clear from hence that it must be near to Sodom, and lay in the way between Damascus and Sodom; whereas Jerusalem was in a contrary situation, and lay nearly forty miles from Sodom; for Josephus saysF13Autiqu. l. 15. c. 6. sect. 2. , the lake Asphaltites, where Sodom once stood, was three hundred furlongs from Jerusalem, which is about thirty eight miles; and Jerom relatesF14Ad Evagrium, tom. 3. fol. 13. E. , that Salem was a town near Scythopolis, which was so called in his times, and where was showed the palace of Melchizedek, which, by the largeness of the ruins, appeared to have been very magnificent, and takes it to be the same place with Shalem in Genesis 33:18 ; and Salim, near to which John was baptizing, John 3:23 , this great man &quot;brought forth bread and wine&quot;; not as a priest for an offering, but as a munificent king, to refresh Abram and his weary troops, and which the king of Sodom could not do, because the victuals of that place were carried off by the four kings, Genesis 14:11 ; and as Abram had the land of Canaan by promise, and now had made conquest in it over the invaders of it, Melchizedek, sensible of his right unto it, brings forth the best fruits of it, and, as Dr. Lightfoot observesF15Works, vol. 1. p. 694. , tenders them to him as &quot;livery and seisin&quot; of it: in this Melchizedek was a type of Christ, who comforts and refreshes his hungry and weary people with himself, the bread of life, and with the wine of his love, as well as his name and title agree with him, who is a righteous King and Prince of Peace, Jeremiah 23:5 , </p>
<p> and he was the priest of the most high God ; a priest as well as a king, as in many countries princes were bothF16&quot;Rex Anius, rex idem hominum Phoebique sacerdos&quot;, Virgil. Aeneid. l. 3. vid. Servium in loc. ; and in this he was a type of Christ in his kingly and priestly offices, who is a priest upon the throne, both king and priest, Zechariah 6:13 . Melchizedek was a priest not of any of the Phoenician deities, but of the true and living God, who is above all gods, dwells in the highest heaven, and is the most High over all the earth; by him was he called to this office and invested with it, and he ministered to him in it. </p>

<p> and said, blessed be Abram of the most high God ; that is, may he be blessed by him who is the most high God, with all kind of blessings, both temporal and spiritual; or he declares him to be blessed of him, as he undoubtedly was, or foretells that he would be, as was certainly his case: and another epithet of God is added, which abundantly shows he was able to bless him, since he is the </p>
<p> possessor of heaven and earth ; is the Maker of both, and has a right to dispose of all things in them, both heavenly and earthly. </p>

<p> which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand ; the four kings, who are called Abram's enemies, because the enemies of God and of true religion, and because they had been injurious to a relation of his; and especially they may be so called, if their intention was, as, say the Jewish writersF17Pirke Eliezer, c. 27.  to slay him, beginning first with Lot: and those four kings, according to them, signify the four monarchies, the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and RomanF18Bereshit Rabba, sect. 42. fol. 37. 1.  who in their turns distressed his posterity, but in the latter day shall fall into their hands, as those did into Abram's, and fall by them: </p>
<p> and he gave him tithes of all ; not Melchizedek to Abram, but Abram to Melchizedek, as appears from Hebrews 7:4 ; and these tithes were given not out of the goods that were recovered, for they were restored to the proprietors of them, but out of the spoils that were taken from the enemy, as is evident from the same place referred to; and these were given both as a return for the respect shown him by Melchizedek, and by way of thankfulness to God for the victory, whose priest he was; otherwise, as a king, he stood in no need of such a present; nor was it for his maintenance as a priest, or what Abram was obliged unto, but was a voluntary action, and not out of his own substance, but out of the spoils of the enemy, and to testify his gratitude to God: this was imitated by the Heathens in later times; so the Tarentines, having got a victory over the Peucetians, sent the tenth (of the spoil) to DelphosF19Pausan. Phocica, sive l. 10. p. 633. : the JewsF20Pirke Eliezer, c. 27.  say Abraham was the first in the world that began to offer tithes; but they are mistaken, when they say in the same place, that he took all the tithes of Sodom and Gomorrah, and of Lot his brother's son, and gave them to Shem the son of Noah. EupolemusF21Apud Euseb. Evang. Praepar. l. 9. c. 17. p. 419.  makes mention of this interview between Abram and Melchizedek by name; he says, Abram was hospitably entertained in the holy city Argarizin, which is by interpretation the mountain of the most High (but seems to be the Mount Gerizzim) and that he received gifts from Melchizedek, the priest of God, who reigned there. </p>

<p> This chapter informs us of a gracious appearance of God to Abram, and of a kind promise made unto him, Genesis 15:1 ; of Abram's request for an heir, Genesis 15:2 ; of an answer to it, that he should have one, and even a numberless seed, Genesis 15:4 ; which he gave credit to, Genesis 15:6 ; upon which he has a fresh promise of the land of Canaan, Genesis 15:7 ; of his inheriting of which he desires a sign, and this was given him, Genesis 15:8 ; and at the same time it was predicted to him how long his posterity should be afflicted in a land not theirs, and afterwards come out with great substance, Genesis 15:13 ; and the grant of the land of Canaan to his seed is renewed, Genesis 15:17 . </p>

<p>After these things ,.... The battle of the kings, the captivity of Lot, the rescue of him and his goods, and of those of Sodom and Gomorrah by Abram, and the conversation that passed between him, and the kings of Sodom and Salem: </p>
<p> the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision ; Christ, the essential Word, appeared to Abram in an human form, visible to him, and with an articulate voice spoke unto him: </p>
<p> saying , as follows: </p>
<p> fear not, Abram ; calling him by his name, the more to encourage him, and to dissipate his fears to which he was subject; which might be, lest the nations that belonged to the four kings he had conquered and slain should recruit their armies, and come against him with greater force; and the brethren and relations of those he had slain should avenge themselves on him, as the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem suggest; and therefore the Lord bids him not give way to those fears, for, adds he: </p>
<p> I am thy shield ; to protect him against all his enemies, be they ever so strong and numerous; as Christ is the shield of his people against all their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, and the world, which being held up in the hand of faith, called therefore the shield of faith, is a security against them: </p>
<p> and thy exceeding great reward ; though he had generously refused taking any reward for the service he had done in pursuing the kings, and slaughtering them, and bringing back the persons and goods they had took away; yet he should be no loser by it, the Lord would reward him in a way of grace with greater and better things; nay, he himself would be his reward, and which must be a great one, an exceeding great one; as Christ is to his people in his person, offices, and grace, all being theirs, and he all in all to them; all the blessings of grace and glory coming along with him, and he being their portion here and hereafter, to all eternity; for since he is theirs, all are theirs, all things appertaining to life and godliness, and eternal life itself. </p>

<p>And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless ,.... As if he should say, what signifies what thou givest me of temporal blessings, if thou withholdest from me the blessing of a child; from whom it might be hoped and believed would spring the promised Messiah, in whom all nations of the earth shall be blessed. All my wealth and riches, victories and honours, are of no avail to me, while I am deprived of this favour; and since I am advanced in years, and going the way of all the earth; or out of the world, as the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase it, and which is the sense of the word in many places, see Joshua 23:14 . Should I depart from hence childless, as I am like to do, what pleasure can I take in them, and comfort from them, when I have none to inherit them? </p>

Strange and various are the fancies of the Jewish writers concerning this Eliezer; the Targum of Jonathan on Genesis 14:14   calls him the son of Nimrod; others say he was the grandson of Nimrod, and others, a servant of his, who gave him to Abram for a servant; and when Isaac married Rebekah he was made free, and through Abram's influence became a king, and was Og king of BashanF26Pirke Eliezer, c. 16. ; and others say he was Canaan the son of HamF1Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 2. 1. ; and others again, that he was Lot, who was very desirous of being Abram's heirF2Bereshit Rabba, sect. 43. fol. 39. 1. : but with neither of these wilt this description of him agree, who is said to be of Damascus; either he was born there, or his parents, one or other, were from thence, who very probably were Abram's servants; and this Eliezer was born in his house, as seems from Genesis 15:3 , or the words may be rendered Damascus EliezerF3&#1491;&#1502;&#1513;&#1511;  &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;   &quot;Damascus Eliezer&quot;, V. L. Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius. , that is, Damascus the son of Eliezer; so that Eliezer was his father's name, and Damascus the proper name of this servant: and some say Damascus was built by him, and had its name from him, which is not likely, since we read of it before, and it is ascribed to another builder; see Gill on Genesis 14:15 . Indeed JustinF4E Trogo, l. 36. c. 2.  says it had its name from a king of it, so called; but who, according to him, was much more ancient than Abram, whom he also makes to be a king of Damascus: after King Damascus, he says, was Azelus, then Adores, and Abram and Israel were kings in that place. And Nicolas of DamascusF5Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 90. c. 16. p. 417.  relates, that Abram reigned at Damascus, when with an army he came out of the land of Chaldea, beyond Babylon; and that the name of Abram was still famous in the region of Damascus, and a certain village was shown, called Abram's habitation: and the Jewish writers sayF6Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 77. 1. , that the servants of Abram built Damascus, and he reigned over it: that Abram lived there some time seems reasonable from this Eliezer, who was born in his house, being called Eliezer of Damascus; for which no other reason can well be assigned than his being born there, which must be therefore when Abram dwelt there, since he was born in his house; and this might be the foundation of the above traditions. </p>

<p> and said, look now towards heaven ; either with his bodily eyes, or with the eyes of his mind: </p>

<p>And he said unto him, take me an heifer of three years old ,.... This, with what follows, is the sign by which Abram might know that he, that is, his seed, should inherit the land of Canaan; for the whole of this is an emblem of the state and condition of his posterity, until they should enter into that land: wherefore he is ordered to &quot;take&quot; out of his herds and flocks this and the following creatures, which were used in sacrifice before the ceremonial law was given, as well as under it; and the distinction of creatures for sacrifice, though not for food, was known as early, as appears from Genesis 8:20 ; hence Onkelos renders the phrase, &quot;offer before me&quot;; and the Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;take unto me oblations, and offer before me.'Though this difference is to be observed, that the Levitical law required creatures of a year old only to be offered; whereas these were three years old, because they are then at their full growth, and in their full strength and greatest perfection; and such were used among the Heathens for sacrifice; so LucianF8Dialogis Deorum.  represents Ganymedes as proposing to Jupiter, that if he would let her go she would offer a ram of three years old: but it should be remarked, that these creatures here were not taken merely for sacrifice, nor is there any mention made of their being offered; though it is probable they might be offered after they had answered the principal end, which was to be a sign, whereby Abram might know that his seed should inherit the land; but the intention of God was, that as by them Abram's seed might be taught what sort of creatures they were to offer for their sins, so chiefly to show that they themselves would fall a sacrifice to the rage and fury of their enemies, in a land not theirs, and be used as these creatures were: and the number three may denote the three complete centuries in which they would be afflicted, and in the fourth come out safe and whole like the undivided birds, the turtle, dove, and pigeon, to which they were comparable. RambanF9Apud Munster in loc.  thinks, that this number represents the three sorts of sacrifices, the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the peace offering; and that of these three kinds of animals, only one individual of them was taken, and is called &quot;treble&quot;, because each individual were joined together. Onkelos renders it three heifers, and so three goats and three rams afterwards; in which he is followed by Jarchi and Ben Melech; the former thinks the three heifers refer to the heifer of the day of atonement, that for uncertain murder, and the red heifer; and in like manner he interprets the three goats and rams; but the Targum of Jonathan, and Aben Ezra, interpret them as we do of creatures of three years old: it follows: </p>
<p> and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove and a young pigeon . Some Jewish writersF11Vid. Bereshit Rabba, sect. 43. fol. 39. 2. Pirke Eliezer, c. 28.  have a notion that these creatures represent the four monarchies; the &quot;heifer&quot;, the Babylonian monarchy, which had three kings, Nebuchadnezzar, Evilmerodach, and Belshazzar; but others make this to be the fourth monarchy, they call Idumaean or Roman, which is like an heifer at grass, Jeremiah 50:11 , which passage better suits with Babylon; the &quot;goat&quot;, Media (or Persia), which had three kings, Cyrus, Darius, and Ahasuerus; and the &quot;ram&quot;, Grecia; but others say the goat signifies the Grecian monarchy, and the ram the Medo-Persian monarchy, which latter agrees with Daniel 8:3 ; and by the &quot;turtle&quot;, the word for which, in the Syriac language, signifies an ox, they understand, some the children of Ishmael, or the Turkish empire, and others Edom, or the Roman: but it is much better to interpret them of Abram's posterity, comparable to these creatures, both for their good and bad qualities; to an &quot;heifer&quot; for laboriousness in service, and patience in sufferings; and for their backslidings, Hosea 4:16 ; to a &quot;goat&quot; for their vicious qualities, their lusts and lasciviousness; and to a &quot;ram&quot;, for their strength and fortitude; and to a &quot;turtle&quot;, and a young pigeon, for their simplicity, innocence, and harmlessness, when they were in their purest state, see Psalm 74:19 ; and it may be observed, that these were the only fowl used in sacrifice. </p>

<p>And he took unto him all these ,....

<p> and divided them in the midst ; that is, the three animals, the heifer, goat, and ram; he did not take off their several limbs, and cut them up in small parts, but cut them in halves: </p>
<p> and laid each piece one against another ; one half against the other, the left side against the right, shoulder against shoulder, and leg against leg, so that they might seem to join, or might be easily joined together again, or however answer one another; though it is generally thought there was such a distance of the one from the other, as that there might be a passage between them; it being usual in making covenants for the covenanters to pass between the parts of a creature slain, signifying, that should they break the covenant made, they deserved to be cut asunder as that creature was; see Gill on Jeremiah 34:18 . So a burning lamp, or lamp of fire, an emblem of the divine Being, is said, Genesis 15:17 , to pass between those pieces: all this was expressive of the afflictions of the posterity of Abram, of their being distressed in the land of Egypt, cut as it were in twain there, and of their various dispersions in other countries; and yet, like the bones in Ezekiel's vision, were gathered together, and united again: and it may be this may have respect to the division of the people of Israel into two kingdoms, in the times of Rehoboam, and their after reunion, and especially in the latter day, Ezekiel 37:7 , </p>
<p> but the birds divided he not ; but laid them one against another, as the pieces were laid; so the birds used in sacrifice under the law were not to be divided, Leviticus 1:17 ; which may signify, that when the people of the Jews, in the latter day, are converted, and brought together into their own land, when they will better answer the character of turtles and doves than they ever did, will be no more divided and separated from each other. </p>

<p> that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs ; this prophecy could not take place at this time, since Abram had then no seed; but at the birth of Isaac, in whom his seed was called, who sojourned, or was a stranger in Gerar, a part of the land of Canaan, as Jacob also in the same land, Genesis 36:3 ; as well as he and his posterity sojourned or lived as strangers in the land of Ham, in Egypt, Psalm 105:23 ; and neither of these countries were theirs; for though there was a grant of Canaan to Abram and his seed, yet it was not in possession; though a land of promise, it was a strange land, a land of their pilgrimage, and where all the patriarchs lived in it as such, see Exodus 6:4 , </p>
<p> and shall serve them ; the inhabitants of the land not theirs, that is, the Canaanites and the Egyptians, especially the latter; and these they served after the death of Joseph, by whom their lives were made bitter with hard bondage: </p>
<p> and they shall afflict them four hundred years ; this term &quot;four hundred years&quot; is not to be joined either with the word &quot;afflict&quot; or &quot;serve&quot;; for their hard servitude and severe affliction did not last long, but a few years at most; but with the phrase, &quot;a stranger in a land not theirs&quot;; and the rest is to be included in a parenthesis thus, and &quot;thy seed shall be a stranger in the land not theirs (and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them) four hundred years&quot;; so long they should be strangers and sojourners, as they were partly in the land of Canaan, and partly in the land of Egypt, neither of which were in their own land, however not in possession; within which space of time they would be in a state of subjection and servitude, and be greatly afflicted and oppressed, as they were particularly by the Egyptians before their deliverance from them, see Exodus 1:11 . These four hundred years, as before observed, are to be reckoned from the birth of Isaac to the Israelites going out of Egypt, and are counted by Jarchi thus; Isaac was sixty years of age when Jacob was born, and Jacob when he went down into Egypt was one hundred and thirty, which make one hundred and ninety; and the Israelites were in Egypt two hundred and ten years, which complete the sum of four hundred: according to Eusebius, there were four hundred and five years from the birth of Isaac to the Exodus of Israel; but the round number is only given, as is very usual; and though the sojourning of the Israelites is said to be four hundred and thirty years, Exodus 12:40 , this takes in the sojourning of Abram in that land, who entered into it sixty five years before the birth of Isaac, which added to four hundred and five, the sum total is four hundred and thirty; for Abram was seventy five years of age when he left Haran and went to Canaan, and Isaac was born when he was an hundred years old, see Genesis 12:4 . </p>

<p> and afterward shall they come out with great substance ; as they did after the four hundred years were ended, and after the Egyptian nation was judged and punished; then they came out of Egypt, with much gold, silver, jewels, and raiment, which they borrowed of the Egyptians, who were spoiled by them, though very justly; this being but a payment of them for the hard and long service with which they had served them; see the exact fulfilment of prophecy, Exodus 11:2 . </p>

Jarchi infers from hence, that Terah, Abram's father, was a penitent, and died a good man, and went to heaven, the place and state of the blessed, whither Abram should go at death; but the phrase of going to the fathers is used both of good and bad men: it is moreover said of Abram, that he should go in peace; being freed from all the fatigues of his journeying from place to place in his state of pilgrimage, and not living to see the afflictions of his posterity, and to have any share in them; and dying in spiritual peace, in tranquillity of mind, knowing in whom he had believed, and where his salvation was safe and secure, and whither he was going; for a good man dies with peace of conscience, having his sins freely forgiven, and he justified from them by the righteousness of the living Redeemer, and enters into eternal peace, see Psalm 37:37 , </p>
<p> thou shall be buried in a good old age ; this signifies that he should live long, see many days and good ones, enjoy much health and prosperity, continue in the ways of truth and righteousness to the end, and come to his grave like a shock of corn fully ripe, and fit for an other world; and that he should have a decent interment in the land of Canaan, where he purchased a burial place, and which was a pledge and earnest of the future possession of it by his seed, the thing here promised. </p>

<p>And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again ,.... The seed of Abram were in the land of Canaan before their descent into Egypt; and it is here predicted and promised, that they should come thither again, as they did, in the fourth generation of those that descended thither; for Moses and Aaron were the fourth from Levi, or Eleazar from Kohath, and Caleb from Judah; or rather this was in the fourth age or century from the birth of Isaac, when the four hundred were up before mentioned, men living at that time about an hundred years: Grotius interprets this of the fourth generation of the Amorites, because of what follows: </p>
<p> for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full ; and therefore as yet would not be turned out of the land, and the seed of Abram could not till then inherit it: wicked people have a measure of iniquity to fill up, which is known of God; some are longer, some are quicker in filling it up, during which time God waits patiently and bears with them; but, when it is completed, he stays no longer, but takes vengeance on them, Matthew 23:32 . The Amorites were only one of the nations of the Canaanites, but were a very strong and powerful one, and are put for them all, and are the rather mentioned, because Abram at this time dwelt among them; and it seems as if there were some good men among them, such as the confederates of Abram might be, and they were not arrived to that depth of wickedness they afterwards would and did, and which brought on their ruin, and so made way for the posterity of Abram to inherit their land.

<p> behold a smoking furnace ; or the likeness of one, as Aben Ezra notes; for all this was represented in a visionary way to Abram, and was an emblem of the great troubles and afflictions of the children of Israel in Egypt, called the iron furnace, Deuteronomy 4:20 , and may have respect to the furnaces in which they burnt the bricks they made, see Exodus 9:8 ; the Jewish paraphrases make this to be a representation of hell, which is prepared for the wicked in the world to come, as a furnace surrounded with sparks and flames of fire; and Jarchi says, it intimated to Abram, that the kingdoms would fall into hell: </p>
<p> and a burning lamp, that passed between those pieces ; or a lamp of fireF15&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1491;  &#1488;&#1513;   &quot;lampas ignis&quot;, V. L. Pagninus, Montanus; so Vatablus, Schmidt. ; an emblem of the Shechinah, or majesty of God, who afterwards appeared in a pillar of fire before the Israelites in the wilderness, after their deliverance out of Egypt, and when their salvation went forth as a lamp that burneth, of which this was a token: this burning lamp passed between the pieces of the heifer, goat, and ram, that Abram had divided in the midst, as was usually done when covenants were made, see Jeremiah 34:18 ; and here God made a covenant with Abram, as appears from Genesis 15:18 ; and, as a confirmation of it, passed between the pieces in a lamp of fire, showing that he was and would be the light and salvation of his people, Abram's seed, and an avenger of their enemies; only God passed between the pieces, not Abram, this covenant being as others God makes with men, only on one side; God, in covenanting with men, promises and gives something unto them, but men give nothing to him, but receive from him, as was the case between God and Abram: however, it is very probable, that this lamp of fire consumed the pieces, in like manner as fire from heaven used to fall upon and consume the sacrifices, in token of God's acceptance of them. </p>

BrocardusF19Apud Drusium in loc.  says,&quot;from Delta to Heliopolis were three miles, where another river was separated from the Nile, and carried to the city of Pelusium; and, adds he, this river is properly called in Scripture the river of Egypt, and at it is bounded the lot of the tribe of Judah.'This river of Egypt, or the Nile, was the southern boundary of the land of Canaan, and from hence to the river Euphrates, the eastern boundary, was the utmost extent of it in which it was ever possessed, as it was in the times of David and Solomon, 2 Samuel 8:3 . </p>

In this and the following verses ten nations are reckoned as occupying the land of Canaan at this time, whereas only seven are mentioned in the times of Moses and Joshua; and these three are not among them, and seem before those times to have been extinct, or were mixed with the other nations, and were no more distinct ones; though Aben Ezra thinks these people had two names, and Jarchi interprets them of the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites, who shall be the inheritance of the children of Israel in future times, according to Isaiah 11:14 ; and so the Jerusalem TalmudF20Sheviith, fol. 37. 2. , from whence he seems to have taken it; and some are of opinion that the Midianites are meant by the Kenites, since Jethro, Moses's father in law, who was of Midian, is called the Kenite, as was also Heber, who was of the same race, Judges 1:16 ; there were Kenites near to the Amalekites in the times of Balaam, and who dwelt among them in the times of Saul, Numbers 24:20 ; as there were also some of this name that descended from the father of the house of Rechab, or the Rechabites, who were associates and proselytes to the people of Israel, 1 Chronicles 2:55 ; the Kenizzites are supposed by some to be the descendants of Kenaz, a grandson of Esau, Genesis 36:11 ; but then they must be so called here by anticipation, since Kenaz was not now born, and rather then would have had the name of Kenazites; besides, none of the land of the children of Esau, at least of those that dwelt about Mount Seir, was to be given to the children of Israel, Deuteronomy 1:5 ; could indeed the Edomites or Idumeans be intended, it might be thought this had its accomplishment in the times of David, and more especially when the Idumeans became Jews, embraced their religion, and were one people with them, in the times of HyrcanusF21Joseph Antiqu. l. 13. c. 9. sect. 1. : the Kadmonites, or the Orientals, were, as BochartF23Canaan, l. 1. c. 19. col. 447.  very probably thinks, the Hivites, who inhabited the eastern part of the land of Canaan about Mount Hermon, and from thence might have their name, as they are in the Jerusalem Targum called the children of the east; and hence came the names of Cadmus and Hermione his wife, who were Hivites, and the fable of their being turned into serpents, which the word Hivites signifies. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 16  </p>
<p> This chapter gives an account of Abram's marrying his maid, at the instance of his wife Sarai, Genesis 16:1 , who, upon conceiving, despised her mistress; of which complaint is made to Abram, who leaving his maid to his wife, to deal with her as she pleased, dealt harshly by her, and therefore fled from her, Genesis 16:4 ; when she was met by an angel, who advised her to return and submit herself to her mistress, and told her her seed would be greatly multiplied, gave a name to the child she went with, and described his temper and disposition, Genesis 16:7 ; and then we have the name of God that spoke to her, and of the place where the discourse passed between them, Genesis 16:13 ; and the chapter is concluded with the birth of Ishmael, and the age of Abram at his birth, Genesis 16:15 . </p>

<p>Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children ,.... She is before said to be barren, and he to be childless, Genesis 11:30 ; God had promised him a seed, but as yet he had none, which was a trial of his faith; he had been married many years to Sarai his wife, she was his wife when they came out of Ur of the Chaldees, and how long before cannot be said; they stayed and dwelt some time at Haran, the JewsF24Seder Olam Rabba, p. 2.  say five years, and they had been now ten years in the land of Canaan, Genesis 16:3 ; and were advanced in years, the one being seventy five, and the other eighty five, so that there was no great probability of having any children, wherefore the following step was taken: </p>
<p> and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar ; no doubt but she had many, but this was a principal one, that might be over others, and was chiefly entrusted with the care and management of family affairs under her mistress; she might be the daughter of an Egyptian, born in Abram's house, as Eliezer was the son of a Syrian of Damascus, born there also; or she might be one of the maidservants Pharaoh, king of Egypt, gave to Abram, Genesis 12:16 ; the JewsF25Targum Jon. & Jarchi in loc. Bereshit Rabba, sect. 45. fol. 40. 2.  have a tradition, that she was a daughter of Pharaoh, who, when he saw the wonders done for Sarai, said, it is better that my daughter should be a handmaid in this house, than a mistress in another, and therefore gave her to Sarai; others sayF26Pirke Eliezer, c. 26.  she was a daughter of his by a concubine, but neither is probable: from her came the people called Hagarites, 1 Chronicles 5:10 , and Hagarenes, Psalm 83:6 ; and there were a people in Arabia called Agraei, both by StraboF1Geograph. l. 16. p. 528.  and PlinyF2Hist. Nat. l. 6. c. 28. ; and the latter speaks of a royal city in that country called Agra, which seem to have their names from this person. MeloF3Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 9. c. 19. p. 420, 421. , an Heathen writer, speaking of Abram, says, that he had two wives, one of his own country, and akin to him, and the other an Egyptian, a servant; of the Egyptian he beget twelve sons, who, going into Arabia, divided the country among them, and were the first that reigned over the inhabitants of it; as to her twelve sons, he mistakes, for these were not Hagar's sons by Abram, but her grandsons, the sons of Ishmael, see Genesis 17:20 . </p>

<p>And Sarai said unto Abram, behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing ,.... Or, &quot;hath shut me up&quot;F4&#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;   &quot;couclusit me&quot;, V. L. Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus, Drusius, Schmidt; &quot;occlusit me&quot;, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius. ; that is, her womb, as were the wombs of the house of Abimelech, Genesis 20:18 ; so that she could not conceive and bear children; she now at this age despaired of having children, perceiving very probably that it ceased to be with her after the manner of women; and this she refers to the will and power of God; for, as children are his gift, and an heritage from him, Psalm 127:3 , so it is his will and pleasure sometimes to withhold this blessing from those who are very desirous of them: </p>
<p> I pray thee go in unto my maid ; Hagar, the Egyptian before mentioned; her meaning is, that he would take her to wife, and use her as such: </p>
<p> it may be that I may obtain children by her ; for whatsoever were born of her handmaid, and in her house, were her own, and so she should account them, and especially as they would be her husband's, see Exodus 21:4 ; or, &quot;may be builded by her&quot;F5&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;   &quot;aedificatur&quot;, Montanus, Piscator, Cocceius, Schmidt, Cartwright; so Ainsworth. ; for women, by bearing children, build up an house, see  4:11 ; hence a son in Hebrew is called &quot;ben&quot;, from &quot;banah&quot;, to build: </p>
<p> and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai ; without consulting God about it, the proposal being agreeable to the flesh, which may be imputed to the infirmity of the good man; though it does not appear to arise from previous lust predominant in him; but both Sarai's proposal, and his compliance with it, might be owing to the eager desire of each after the promised seed; they both believed the promise, but did not know it, being not as yet revealed, that Abram should have a son by Sarai; so that Sarai knowing her own case and circumstances, might conclude it was to be by another, and by her handmaid; and Abram might reason and judge after the same manner, which inclined him to listen to her: JosephusF6Antiqu. l. 1. c. 10. sect. 4.  says, indeed, that Sarai moved this to Abram by the direction and order of God himself; and the Jewish writers sayF7Jarchi in loc. Bereshit Rabba, ut supra. (sect. 45. fol. 2.) , that Abram hearkened to the Holy Spirit of God that was in her. </p>

<p>And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian ,.... Took her by the hand, it is probable, and led her into the apartment where Abram was, and presented her to him; their characters are very exactly described, and the contrast beautifully given, that the affair might be the more remarkable and observable: </p>
<p> after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan ; so that he was now eighty five years of age, for he was sventy five when he departed from Haran and came into Canaan, Genesis 12:4 ; and Sarai, being ten years younger than he, must be sventy five; the Jews from hence have formed a rule or canon; that if a man marries a woman, and she has no children in ten years, he is obliged to marry anotherF8Bereshit Rabba, ut supra. (sect. 45. fol. 40. 2.). Jarchi & Aben Ezra in loc. : </p>
<p> and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife ; his secondary wife, or concubine; which, though contrary to the first institution of marriage, was connived at of God, and was practised by good men: nothing can excuse them but their earnest desire after the Messiah, the promised seed; and one may conclude, that nothing but this especially could move Sarai to take such a step, so contrary to the temper and disposition of women in common. </p>

<p> her mistress was despised in her eyes ; she thought herself above her, and treated her as her inferior, with contempt, and reproached her for her barrenness, as Peninnah did Hannah, 1 Samuel 1:6 ; and it was the more ungrateful, as it was at the motion of her mistress that she was given to Abram for wife. </p>

<p>And Sarai said to Abram ,.... Being affronted with the behaviour of her maid to her, she applies to Abram for the redress of her grievance, judging it, perhaps, below her dignity to enter into an altercation with her maid: </p>
<p> my wrong be upon thee ; in her passion imprecating evil on him, as a just punishment upon him for suffering wrong to be done her by her maid; or, &quot;is upon thee&quot;F9&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;&#1497;  &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;   &quot;injuria mea super te est&quot;, Cocceius; so Ainsworth. ; pointing at his duty, and suggesting to him what he ought to do; that it was incumbent on him as her husband to right her wrongs, and do her justice, and vindicate her from the calumnies and reproaches of her servant; and tacitly complaining of him, and accusing him with indolence and unconcern at the injury done her, being silent when it became him to check her insolence and chide her for it: or, &quot;is for thee&quot;F11&quot;Vel injuria mea est propter te&quot;, Cocceius; &quot;quid si legamus propter te?&quot; Drusius. ; for thy sake; it was for the sake of Abram chiefly, that he might have a son and heir, which he was very solicitous, that she gave him her maid to wife; the consequence of which was, that she was now insulted and abused by her, and so suffered wrong for his sake; and the rather she might be tempted to say it was on his account, as she might be jealous of a growing affection in him to Hagar, and that he showed greater respect to her, being likely to have a child by her, and so connived at her haughtiness and arrogance: </p>
<p> I have given my maid into thy bosom ; to be his wife, Micah 7:5 ; Sarai had no reason to upbraid Abram with this, since it was not at his solicitations she gave her to him, but it was her own motion: </p>
<p> and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes ; when she found herself with child, and hoped to bring forth a son, that should be heir to Abram's large possessions, and inherit the land of Canaan, given to his seed, she began to think highly of herself, and looked with disdain upon her mistress, set lightly by her, made no account of her, showed her no respect, carried it haughtily to her, as if she was beneath her, and as if she had more authority in the house, and a better claim to the affection of Abram, and deserving of more honour and respect, as she was favoured of God with conception, a blessing Sarai never enjoyed: </p>
<p> the Lord judge between me and thee : which was very rashly and hastily said, as if Abram was not inclined and was unwilling to do her justice, and therefore she appeals to God against him, as an unrighteous man, and desires that he would interpose, and by his providence show who was in the right and who in the wrong: or &quot;the Lord will judge&quot;F12&#1497;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;   &quot;judicabit&quot;, Junius & Tremellius. ; expressing her confidence not only in the justness of her cause, but in the appearance of divine Providence in her favour; believing that the Lord would arise and help her, and defend her against the insults made upon her, and resent the injury done her. </p>

<p>But Abram said unto Sarai ,.... In a meek, mild and gentle manner: </p>
<p> behold, thy maid is in thine hand ; though Hagar was Abram's secondary wife he still considers her as Sarai's maid, and as subject to her, and allows her to exercise authority over her; for he still retained the same love and affection for Sarai, his first and lawful wife, and showed the same respect he ever did, and supported her in her honour and dignity: </p>
<p> do to her as it pleaseth thee : not giving her liberty to take away her life, nor even to use her cruelly, but to deal with her as a mistress might lawfully do with a servant, or however exercise that power which a first wife had over a second: perhaps Abram, in complaisance to Sarai, gave her too large a commission, and left it too much in her power to distress Hagar; and it might have been more correct to have heard both sides, and judged between them, and used his own authority, by reproving and correcting as he saw meet; had she been only Sarai's maid and not his wife, it would have been less exceptionable; however, for peace sake, he gave leave to Sarai to do as she would: </p>
<p> and when Sarai dealt hardly with her ; or afflicted herF13&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;   &quot;eam affligeret&quot;, Tigurine version, Schmidt; &quot;afflixit eam&quot;, Fagninus, Montanus, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator; so Ainsworth. , not only with words but with blows, as some think, and unmercifully beat her, and laid hard service upon her she was not able to go through, especially in her circumstances; though it may be she only chastised her in such a manner as a mistress may chastise her maid, since the angel seems to approve of what she did, Genesis 16:9 ; which her proud spirit not being able to bear: </p>
<p> she fled from her face ; which was set against her, and was full of wrath and fury: she deserted her service, quitted Abram's house though with child by him; unmindful of the various relations she stood in, which should have obliged her to have kept her place, and especially until she had made proper remonstrances of her ill usage, and could have no redress; but, unable to bear the treatment she met with, meditated a flight into her own country, Egypt, for by what follows it appears she steered her course that way; this flight of hers was agreeable to her name, for Hagar in the Arabic language signifies to &quot;flee&quot;, hence the flight of Mahomet is called the Hegira. </p>

<p>And the angel of the Lord found her ,.... This is the first time that mention is made of an angel in Scripture, but is not to be understood of a created angel, but of a divine Person, as appears from Genesis 16:10 , the uncreated angel, the Logos or Son of God, called the Angel of God's presence, and the Angel of the covenant, Isaiah 63:9   Malachi 3:1 ; who often appeared in an human form before his incarnation, being sent by his divine Father on one account or another; and hence called an angel, a messenger, or one sent, as in the fulness of time he was sent in human nature to be the Redeemer of his people; though many of the Jewish writers take this angel to be a man sent of God. GersomF14Comment in loc.  says he was one of the prophets that lived in those times, and observes, that some of their Rabbins sayF15Bereshit Rabba, sect. 45. fol. 41. 1.  he was Shem, the son of Noah; and MaimonidesF16Moreh Nevochim, par. 2. c. 42. p. 311.  suggests, that this angel was but a mere man, by comparing this passage with that in Genesis 37:15 , &quot;a certain man found him&quot;, &c. but the context most clearly confutes this notion, and proves him to be the almighty and omniscient God; since he promises to do what none but the omnipotent Being could do, and declares such things as none but the omniscient God could know: and when it is said he &quot;found Hagar&quot;, it is not to be understood as if it was a chance matter, or the fruit and effect of search and inquiry, or as if he had not seen her before; but rather it shows that his eye was upon her, and he had a concern for her, and at a proper time and place appeared to her at once, and unawares, and unthought of by her. And the place where he found her was </p>
<p> by a fountain of water in the wilderness ; which lay between Egypt and Canaan, the same through which the Israelites passed afterwards from the one to the other: here was a fountain of water, and meeting with it she stopped to refresh herself: </p>
<p> by the fountain in the way to Shur ; a place before or over against Egypt, from whence the wilderness had its name, see Genesis 25:18 , which shows that she was making her way to Egypt, as fast as she could, her native country, where in all probability she proposed to continue, and never return more: what the name of the place the angel found her at was, at that time, is not certain, or whether it had any; for it seems to be so called from the Lord's &quot;looking&quot; upon her here, which &quot;Shur&quot; signifies: the Jerusalem Targum calls it Chalaza; and both the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan name it Chagra or Hagra, after her own name, as it should seem: and it is remarkable, that this very place, and the wilderness, and parts adjacent, were the habitation of her posterity, the sons of Ishmael, Genesis 25:18 ; and must be in Arabia Petraea, which they inhabited; and PtolemyF17Geograph. l. 5. c. 17.  speaks of a city called Suratta, in that country. </p>

<p> whence camest thou ? this question the angel asked, not as ignorant, for he that could call her by her name, and describe her character and state, knew from whence she came; but he said this not only to lead on to what he had further to say to her, but to put her upon considering from whence she came, what she had left behind, and what blessings she had deprived herself of; she had not only left her husband and her mistress, but the house of God; for such Abram's family was, where the worship of God was kept up, and where the Lord granted his presence, and indulged with communion with himself: </p>
<p> and whither wilt thou go ? he knew her intention and resolution was to go to Egypt, and he would have her think of the place whither she intended to go, as well as that she had left, as that her journey to it was dangerous, through a wilderness; that the country she was bound for was a wicked and an idolatrous one, where she would not have the free exercise of her religion she had embraced, nor any opportunity of attending the pure worship of God, and would be liable to be drawn into a sinful course of life, and into idolatrous worship: </p>
<p> and she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai ; this was very ingenuously said, she acknowledges Sarai to be her mistress, and owns that, she had displeased her, and caused her face to be against her; and confesses the truth, that she had fled from her, not being able to bear her frowns and corrections, at least her spirit was too high to submit to them. </p>

<p> behold, thou art with child ; this she knew, and it is said, not for her information, as to this respect, but to lead on to something else he had to acquaint her with, she did not know. Jarchi indeed would have the sense to be, &quot;thou shall conceive&quot; or &quot;be with child&quot;, as was said to Manoah's wife, Judges 13:5 ; for it is a fancy of his, that Hagar had miscarried, and he, supposes the angel to promise her, that if she would return, or when she should return, she should conceive again; but this is said and supposed without any foundation: </p>

Diodor. Sicul.

And a late traveller into those parts observesF23Dr. Shaw's Travels, p. 238, 239.

<p> thou God seest me ; she perceived by experience his eye was upon her wherever she was, and saw all she did; saw all her transgressions, her contempt of her mistress, and her flight from her; saw her when she was at the fountain, and reproved and recalled her, and sent her back; saw all the workings of her heart, her repentance and sorrow for her sins; looked and smiled upon her, and gave her exceeding great and precious promises: he looked upon her, both with his eye of omniscience and providence, and with his eye of love, and grace, and mercy; yea, she was sensible that he was not only the God that saw her, but saw all things; was God omniscient, and therefore gives him this name under a thorough conviction and deep sense of his omniscience; and so Onkelos paraphrases the words,&quot;thou art he, the God that sees all things;&quot; </p>
<p> for she said, have I also here looked after him that seeth me ? this she said within herself, either as blaming herself, that she should not look after God in this desolate place until now, and call upon him, and praise his name, whose eye was upon her, and had a concern for her, and care over her; and yet so ungrateful she had been as to neglect him, and not seek after him as it became her: or as wondering that here, in this wilderness, she should be favoured with the sight of God, and of his angel, whom she had seen in Abram's house; where to see him was not so strange and marvellous, but it was to have a sight of him in such a place, and under such circumstances as she was: or else as admiring that she should be alive after she had had such a vision of God, it being a notion that pretty much obtained, that none could see God and live, only his back parts were to be seen; wherefore others read the words, and they will bear such a version, &quot;have not I also seen here the back parts of him that seeth me?&quot;F25So Fagius.  so Moses did, Exodus 33:23 . </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 17  </p>
<p> This chapter treats of a covenant made with Abram, sometimes called the covenant of circumcision, the time when God appeared to him, and promised to make it, and did, Genesis 17:1 ; the particulars of it, both with respect to himself, whose name was now changed, and to his posterity, Genesis 17:4 ; the token of it, circumcision, the time of its performance, and the persons obliged to it, Genesis 17:9 ; the change of Sarai's name, and a promise made that she should have a son, to the great surprise of Abraham, Genesis 17:15 ; a prayer of his for Ishmael, and the answer to it, with a confirmation of Sarah's having a son, whose name should be called Isaac, and the establishment of the covenant with him, Genesis 17:18 ; and the chapter is closed with an account of the circumcision of Abraham, and all his family of the male sort, agreeably to the command of God, Genesis 17:23 . </p>

<p>And when Abram was ninety years old and nine ,.... Which was thirteen years after the birth of Ishmael last mentioned; so many years more it was before be is expressly told he should have a son by Sarai, or had the promise of Isaac, which was for the trial of his faith; and his age is here observed, that the power of God might be more manifest in fulfilling his promise, and giving him a son by Sarai: </p>
<p> the Lord appeared to Abram ; in a visible manner, in an human form very probably, even the Logos, the Word and Son of God: it seems as if the Lord had not appeared to him since the birth of Ishmael, until this time; and if so, it may be thought to be a correction of him for listening to the voice of his wife in marrying Hagar, without asking counsel of God: </p>
<p> and said unto him, I am the Almighty God ; as the Word of God is, as appears by his creation of all things, his in sustaining of them, his government of the church, his redemption of it, and preservation of his people safe to glory, see Revelation 1:8 ; and this epithet is very appropriate here, when the Lord was about to give out a promise of a son to Abram and Sarai, so much stricken in years. Some render it &quot;all sufficient&quot;F3&#1488;&#1500;  &#1513;&#1491;&#1497;   &quot;Deus sufficiens&quot;, Cocceius; so Jarchi and Ainsworth. , as Jehovah is, sufficient in and of himself, and for himself, and stands in no need of any, or of anything from another; and has a sufficiency for others, both in a way of providence and grace: </p>
<p> walk before me : not as though Abram had not so walked, or had discontinued his walk before God, but that he would go on to walk by faith in a dependence on him for everything he wanted, both with respect to things temporal and spiritual; and to walk in all his commandments and ordinances, that he either had given, or should give him; and all this as in his presence, and under his watchful eye, that sees and observes all things, and before whom all things are naked and open, as all are to the essential Word of God, Hebrews 4:12 , </p>
<p> and be thou perfect : upright and sincere in acts of faith, and in duties of religion, and go on to perfection; which though a sinless one is not attainable in this life, is desirable, and is to be had in Christ, though not in ourselves: but here it chiefly denotes an holy and unblamable life and conversation, which though not entirely free from sin, yet without any notorious ones, which bring dishonour to God, and disgrace upon a man's character and profession, see Genesis 6:9 . This respects not perfection in his body or flesh, as the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases it, through circumcision, by which the JewsF4Jarchi in loc. Pirke Eliezer, c. 29. Misn. Nedarim, c. 13. sect. 11.  fancy Abram became perfect, but was not till circumcised. </p>

<p> which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee ; which was to be observed by Abraham, and the males in his house then with him, as Ishmael, and those that were born in his house, or bought with his money, and by his posterity in succeeding ages, and it is what follows: </p>
<p> every man child among you shall be circumcised ; this was the first institution of circumcision, and it was an institution of God, and not of man. Indeed Herodotus saysF13Euterpe sive, l. 2. c. 104. , that&quot;the Colchi, Egyptians, and Ethiopians only of all men circumcised from the beginning; and the Phoenicians and Syrians, which are in Palestine, learnt it of the Egyptians, as they themselves confess.'So Diodorus SiculusF14Bibliothec. l. 4. p. 24. & l. 3. p. 165.  speaks of circumcision as an Egyptian rite, and says there are some who make the nation of the Colchi, and of the Jews, to come from the Egyptians: hence he observes, that with these nations there is an ancient tradition to circumcise their newborn infants, which rite was derived from the Egyptians: but as the original of the Jewish nation is mistaken, so likewise the original this rite. And they may as well be thought to be mistaken in the one as in the other. Those in Palestine that were circumcised were the Jews only, as JosephusF15Contr Apion. l. 1. c. 22.  observes; but they did not learn this rite from the Egyptians, nor do they ever confess it, but on the contrary suggest, that the Egyptians learnt it from them in the times of Joseph; for their principal lexicographer saysF16Raal Aruch in Rad. &#1502;&#1500;   fol. 91. 1. , the Egyptians were circumcised in the times of Joseph, and when Joseph died they drew over the foreskin of the flesh. The Colchi indeed, who were a colony of the Egyptians, might learn it from them; and so the Ethiopians, who were their neighbours likewise, and agreed with them in many things. ArtapanusF17Apud Euseb. Evangel Praepar. l. 9. c. 27. p. 433. , an Heathen writer, says, indeed, that the Ethiopians, though enemies, had such a regard for Moses, that they learned from him the rite of circumcision; and not only they, but all the priests, that is, in Egypt; and indeed the Egyptian priests only, and not the people, were circumcised. It is not very difficult to account for it, how other nations besides the Jews should receive circumcision, which was first enjoined Abraham and his seed; the Ishmaelites had it from Ishmael the son of Abraham; from them the old Arabs; from the Arabs, the Saracens; and from the Saracens, the Turks to this day: other Arabian nations, as the Midianites, and others, had it from the sons of Abraham by Keturah; and perhaps the Egyptians and Ethiopians from them, if the former had it not from the Israelites; and the Edomites had it from Edom or Esau, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham; so that all originally had it from Abraham, and he by a divine command. It is not so much to be wondered at, that Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, men either imposed upon by the Egyptian priests, as the former, or wrote in favour of that nation, as the latter, and wholly ignorant of divine revelation, should assert what they have done; but that Christian writers, who have the advantage of divine revelation, and have read the history of the Bible, such as Marsham, Spencer, and Le Clerc, should incline to the same sentiment, is amazing; and especially when our blessed Lord has expressly said in John 7:22 , that circumcision is &quot;of the fathers&quot;, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, first given to them, and practised by them. Even TheodotusF19Apud Euseb. ut supra, (Evangel Praepar. l. 9.) c. 22. p. 428. , an Heathen writer, agrees with this sacred testimony of Moses, when speaking of the circumcision of Shechem, in the times of Jacob, he traces this rite to its original, and observes, that when Abraham was brought out of his own country, he was ordered &quot;from heaven&quot; to circumcise every man in his house. It may indeed seem strange how it should obtain in the islands of the West Indies, as in Jucatana, Sancta Crux, and others, where the Spaniards found in the beginning of the sixteenth century those isles inhabited by idolaters, who were circumcisedF20Vid.

Schulchan Aruch, ib. sect. l. ), even an uncircumcised person, and a servant, and a woman, and a little one may circumcise where there is no man, but a Gentile may not circumcise at all; and if he does circumcise, there is no need to repeat it, and to circumcise a second time.'It is a little differently expressed by anotherF2Schulchan Aruch, ib sect 1.  writer of theirs,&quot;all are fit to circumcise, even a servant, a woman, and a little one, and an uncircumcised Israelite, whose brethren died through circumcision; but it there is an Israelite grown, and knows how to circumcise, he is to be preferred before them all; (some say a woman may not circumcise;) but an idolater, though he is circumcised, may not circumcise at all; but if he does, there is no need to repeat it, and to circumcise else a second time:&quot; </p>
<p> and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you : of the promise of God to Abraham, that he should be the father of many nations. The apostle explains it, Romans 4:11 ; to be a seal, or what gave assurance to Abraham, or was a sure token to him, that righteousness would be wrought out by Christ, by his obedience, and the shedding of his blood, which is received by faith; and that this was imputed to him while he was uncircumcised, Genesis 15:6 ; and that this also would &quot;be in the uncircumcision&quot;, or uncircumcised Gentiles that should believe as he did, and be imputed to them, as to him, and so he would appear to be the father of them all. Moreover, this was a sign or token of that part of the promise or covenant, which gave to his seed the land of Canaan: this was a seal of the lease of that land, which was made while Abraham was in it, and which the Israelites were obliged to submit to, upon entrance into it in Joshua's time, as a token of it; and which they were to observe while in it until the Messiah's coming, and by which they were distinguished from other nations, and kept a distinct nation, that it might appear he came of them: and to use the words of TacitusF3Hist. l. 5. c. 5. , this rite was instituted &quot;ut diversitate noscantur&quot;, that they might be distinguished and known from others; it was typical of Christ, the end of it, who submitted to it, that it might appear he was really man, a son of Abraham, and a minister of the circumcision, and was made under the law, and so laid under obligation to fulfil it; and that he was to satisfy for the sins of men by the effusion of his blood, and endure pains and sufferings, signified thereby: it was also an emblem of spiritual circumcision, or circumcision of the heart, which ties in the putting off the body of sin, in renouncing man's own righteousness, and in his being by the grace of God, and blood of Christ, cleansed from the impurity of his nature, propagated by carnal generation, in which the member circumcised has a principal concern. </p>

<p>And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you ,.... A son or infant of eight days old; it might not be circumcised before, but for some reasons might be deferred longer. The reasons why this rite was ordered to be performed in infancy, according to MaimonidesF4Moreh Nevochim, par. 3. c. 49. p. 506. , were, because if it had been deferred to riper age it might have been neglected, and never performed; and because at such an age the pain is not so sensibly felt, by reason of the tenderness of the skin, and the weakness of the imagination; as also because the affections of parents are not then so strong as they are when one year, and especially three or four years old; and particularly it was ordered on the eighth day, because all animals, as soon as born, on account of their great humidity, are very weak, and scarce any other than they were in their mother's womb, until the end of seven days, after which they begin to be reckoned among those that perceive the air of this world; and so he remarks the same is to be observed in beasts, that seven days they were to be with their dam, Exodus 22:30 . According to the Jewish canonF5Misn. Sabbat, c. 19. sect. 5. ,&quot;an infant might be circumcised on the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, neither less nor more; (not less than eight days, nor more than twelveF6Misn. Eracin, c. 2. sect. 2. ;) according to the usual custom on the eighth; if he was born between the two evenings, he is circumcised on the ninth; if between the two evenings of the evening of the sabbath, he is circumcised on the tenth; if on a festival day, after the sabbath, he is circumcised on the eleventh; if on the two days of the beginning of the year, he is circumcised on the twelfth: an infant that is sick, they do not circumcise it until it is well.'Which sickness they interpret not of sore eyes, and the like, but of an ague or fever; and when a child on the eighth day is red or yellow, or a woman has lost her children through circumcision, two or three one after another, then it is deferred; and they reckon seven days from a child's recovery from sickness, and then circumcise itF7Maimon. Hilchot Milah, c. 1. sect. 16, 17, 18. Schulchan Aruch, ib. c. 262. sect. 2. 263. sect. 1, 2. ; but circumcision on the eighth day was always reckoned most valid and authentic, and according to rule; see Gill on Philemon 3:5 ; and the Jews were careful to do it on the eighth day as soon as they could, though only when and while it was day. Their canon or rule runs thusF8Schulchan Aruch, c. 262. sect. 1. ,&quot;they do not circumcise until the sun shines out on the eighth day of a child's birth, and all the day is fit for circumcision; but they that are prepared hasten to the commandment, and circumcise immediately in the morning; and indeed circumcision, which is not in its proper time, is never performed but in the day:'for they observeF9Maimon. Hilchot Milah, c. 1. sect. 8. , it is said on the eighth day, Leviticus 12:3 ; the day, and not the night. And this was to be done to </p>

Whose circumcision was neglected by his father, or by his mother, or by the civil magistrate, or by himself; for each of these, according to the Jewish canons, were obliged to see this performed;&quot;the commandment lies upon a father to circumcise his son, and upon a master to circumcise his servants born in his house, or bought with moneyF13Maimon. ut supra, (Hilchot Milah) c. 1. sect. 1. :'and it is elsewhere saidF14Schulchan Aruch, ib. c. 361. sect. 1. ,&quot;if a father does not circumcise his son, the sanhedrim are bound to circumcise him; and if they do not circumcise him, he is obliged when he is grown up to circumcise himself; and if he does not circumcise himself, he is guilty of cutting off,'as it here follows: </p>
<p> that soul shall be cut off from his people ; which Jarchi interprets of his being childless, and dying before his time; and which, according to some in Aben Ezra, is, when a man dies before he is fifty two years of age; and some erroneous persons, as the same writer calls them, thought that if a child died, and was not circumcised, it had no part in the world to come. The simplest and plainest meaning of the phrase seems to be, that such should be cut off, and deprived of all civil and religious privileges with the Israelites in the land of Canaan, and be reckoned as Heathens. Concerning this matter, MaimonidesF15Maimon. Hilchot. Milah, c. 1. sect. 1,2.  thus writes;&quot;a father or a mother that transgress, and circumcise not, make void the affirmative commandment, but are not guilty of cutting off; for no cutting off depends but upon the uncircumcised person himself; and the sanhedrim are commanded to circumcise a son or a servant in its time, that they may not leave an uncircumcised person in Israel, nor among their servants; if the thing is hid from the sanhedrim, and they do not circumcise him, when he is grown up, he is bound to circumcise himself; and every day that passes over him, after he is grown up, and he does not circumcise himself, lo, he maketh the commandment to cease; but he is not guilty of cutting off until he dies, and he is a presumptuous uncircumcised person;'and so, according to him, this must respect his punishment after death in another world: </p>

<p>Then Abraham fell upon his face ,.... In reverence of the divine Being, and as amazed at what was told him: </p>
<p> and laughed ; not through distrust and diffidence of the promise, as Sarah did, for he staggered not at that through unbelief, but for joy at such good news; and so Onkelos renders it, &quot;and he rejoiced&quot;, with the joy of faith; it may be our Lord refers to this in John 8:56 ; he saw Christ in the promise of Isaac, and rejoiced that he should spring from his seed: the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase it, &quot;and he wondered&quot;; he was amazed at the grace of God that gave him such a promise, and he was astonished at the power of God that must be exerted in the fulfilment of it: and therefore it follows: </p>
<p> and said in his heart ; within himself, without expressing anything as to be heard and understood by any creature; but the omniscient God knew what he said, and the language of it, whether of unbelief or not: </p>
<p> shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? not that he was now a full an hundred years old, he was ninety nine, and going in his hundredth year; but then he would be, as he was, an hundred years old when this child was born to him, Genesis 21:5 . It had been no unusual thing for a child to be born to a man when an hundred, and even many hundred years old, but it was so in Abraham's time; though indeed after this we read that Abraham himself had six sons by Keturah, when, his natural strength was afresh invigorated, and his youth was renewed like the eagle's; and besides Abraham said this, not so much with respect to himself, though his age was a circumstance that served to heighten the wonder, as with respect to Sarah, and the circumstances in which she was, who was to bear this son to him: </p>
<p> and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear ? and with whom it had ceased to be after the manner of women, which made it more difficult of belief how it could be. Some think that Abraham said this, as somewhat doubting of it, until he was more strongly assured by the Lord that so it would be indeed, as is expressed in Genesis 17:19 ; but meeting with no reproof for what he said and did, as Sarah, it seems to show the contrary. </p>

<p> O that Ishmael might live before thee ; he prays that his life might be preserved, and that it might be spent in the fear, worship, and service of God; so the Targum of Jonathan,&quot;O that Ishmael might live and worship before thee,'and to the same sense Jarchi also; that he might enjoy the favour of God, his gracious presence and communion with him; that he might live a holy spiritual life here, acceptable and well pleasing to God, and possess eternal life hereafter: for we must take this prayer in as large a sense as we can suppose the heart of a father to be drawn forth in it for the good of his child; though it may greatly respect his sharing with the promised son in his blessings, and particularly regards the propagation of his offspring, or his living in his posterity at least; this was what the Lord took notice of, and answered him in. </p>

<p> and thou shall call his name Isaac ; which signifies &quot;laughter&quot;; and which name was given him from the laughter of Abraham at the promise of him, and not from the laughter of Sarah, which as yet was not; wherefore JosephusF16Antiqu. l. 1. c. 12. sect. 2.  is wrong when he suggests, that Isaac had this name from Sarah's laughing at God's saying, that she should bear a son: though his birth was matter of laughter and joy to both, as it was to all good people that heard of it, Genesis 21:8 .

The Egyptians, according to AmbroseF2De Abraham, l. 2. c. 11. p. 266. , circumcised their children at fourteen years of age, which comes pretty near to the time of the Ishmaelites or Arabs, from whom they might receive circumcision, if not of the Israelites, as before observed. A certain traveller saysF3Baumgarten. Peregrin. l. 1. c. 16. , the modern Egyptians, as the rest of the Mahometans, are not circumcised until the thirteenth year. The Africans circumcise on the seventh day, which comes nearer to the JewsF4Leo. African. Descriptio Africae, l. 3. p. 33. . </p>

<p>In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.  This is repeated, that it might be taken notice of that both were circumcised according to the command of God, and on the very day in which it was given. Jarchi observes, it was in the day, and not in the night; which shows, says he, he was not afraid of the Heathen, and of mockers; and that his enemies, and the men of that generation, might not say, if we had seen him, we would not have suffered him to be circumcised, and keep the commandment of God: and some of the Jewish writersF5Pirke Eliezer, ut supra. (c. 29.)  fable, that he was circumcised on the day afterwards appointed by Moses for the day of atonement, and that in the place where he was circumcised the altar was built; but all this is without any foundation. This affair was transacted, according to Bishop UsherF6Annales Ver. Test. p. 8. , A. M. 2107, and before Christ 1897. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 18  </p>
<p> Another appearance of God to Abraham is here recorded; three persons are seen by him in an human form, whom he kindly invites to stop with him, and generously entertains them, Genesis 18:1 ; they inquire concerning Sarah his wife, and one of them renews the promise of her bearing a son to him, which occasions laughter in her, for which she is reproved, Genesis 18:9 ; upon their departure the Lord thought fit, for reasons given, to make known to Abraham his intention to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, Genesis 18:16 ; when Abraham intercedes for the preservation of those cities in a most importunate and affectionate manner, Genesis 18:23 . </p>

<p>And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre ,.... That is, to Abraham; and very likely this appearance of God was quickly after the affair of the circumcision, to show his approbation of his ready obedience to his command; and at this time he was in the plains, or at the oaks of Mamre, the oaken grove there, as has been observed on Genesis 13:18 ; and which seems to be the best rendering of the words, since in Genesis 18:4 ; mention is made of a tree to sit and stand under; and Abraham might choose this place for his habitation, because of the shadiness of it, in those hot countries: </p>
<p> and he sat in the tent door, in the heat of the day ; partly to cool and refresh himself, and partly to observe if any passengers passed by, to invite them in; this being a time of day when such needed refreshment, and it was proper for them to lie by a while, and not proceed on their journey until it was cooler: or rather to or &quot;near&quot; the tent door, as NoldiusF7Ebr. Concord. Part. p. 13. , or before it, without or under the shade of the tree, after mentioned. </p>
<h2 pb_toc="index">18:2</h2>
<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 18:2" display="now" /><b>Gen 18:2</b></p>


<p>And he lifted up his eyes and looked ,.... To see if he could observe any passengers coming that way: </p>
<p> and, lo, three men stood by him ; having perhaps descended at once from heaven upon the spot near where Abraham sat; for these, whoever they were, appeared in an human form, and they were took by Abraham at first sight to be men, and as such he treated them: some have taken these to be the three divine Persons, as some of the ancients; of which opinion was Dr. Lightfoot, who expressly saysF8Works, vol. 1. p. 13. ,&quot;three months after this, (i.e. the institution of the circumcision,) the three Persons in the Trinity dine with Abraham, and foretell the birth of Isaac; again, the Son and the Holy Ghost go down to Sodom, but the first Person in the Trinity stayeth with Abraham'and elsewhereF9Ib. p. 695. ,&quot;the three Persons in the Trinity, in the shape of three men, appear to Abraham and dine with him, and eat the first flesh mentioned eaten in all the Scripture.'But to this may be objected, that the Father and the Holy Spirit are never said to appear in an human form, see John 5:37 ; or are ever called angels, as these are, Genesis 19:1 ; but they rather seem to be angels, as the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem call them, in the likeness of men, who were sent on three messages, as they suggest; one to bring the news of Sarah's bearing Isaac; the other to deliver Lot; and the third to overthrow Sodom and Gomorrah; which is a much better sense than that of Ben Gersom, who takes them to be three prophets, and mentions the names of two of them, Shem and Heber; for two of these are expressly called angels, Genesis 19:1 ; and the apostle seems to refer to this history, Hebrews 13:2 ; in the TalmudF11T. Bab. Yoma, fol. 37. 2.  they are said to be Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael: the truth of the matter seems to be this, that one of them was the son of God in an human form, that chiefly conversed with Abraham, and who rained from heaven brimstone on Sodom; and the other two were angels in the like form that accompanied him in that expedition: </p>
<p> and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door ; for, though they are before said to stand &quot;by him&quot;, it must be understood of their being near him, but at some little distance; and as soon as he saw them, he did not stay for their coming up to him, but, to show how ready he was to entertain them, he arises from his seat at the tent door and ran to meet them, and gave them an hearty welcome to what he would provide for them: </p>
<p> and bowed himself toward the ground ; not in a way of religious adoration, for, had he took them for angels, be could not have done that, and he knew not as yet that one of them was Jehovah; but in a civil manner, as was the custom of those countries when in the presence of, or when they received? great personages, and such, by their look and habit, Abraham took these to be. </p>

<p>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah ,.... In order to acquaint her with his guests, and to give proper instructions for providing food for them; and this he hasted to do, being hearty in the entertainment of them, and that he might not keep them too long from their journey: </p>
<p> and said , to Sarah his wife: </p>
<p> make ready quickly three measures of fine meal ; which was ready sifted from the bran, and was the finest flour that was in the house, and only wanted to be mixed and kneaded and made up into cakes; and he ordered three measures or seahs of them, each of which held more than our peck, and all three made an ephah or bushel, being willing to have enough, and to make a generous entertainment for them; this he enjoined Sarah to do, but not of herself, but by her maids, and no doubt, for quicker dispatch, she might assist herself, wherefore it follows: </p>
<p> knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth ; after the fine flour was made dough and kneaded, it was made into round cakes, and these were put upon an hearth made hot, and then covered with hot embers, by which means they were soon baked and fit to eat; this was done &quot;upon hot stones&quot;F14Bochart.

<p>And he took butter and milk ,.... Jarchi says, it was the fat of the milk gathered from the top of it, he means cream, and is different both from butter and from milk: this was either Abraham himself, who took and brought these, as Sarah or her maidens might bring the cakes when baked; or else Abraham's young man, since it follows: </p>
<p> and the calf which he had dressed ; either the whole of it, or some principal parts of it, reckoned the finest and choicest; though by what follows it seems to be Abraham himself, who may be said to dress the calf, it being done by his orders: </p>
<p> and set it before them ; a table being placed under the tree, he set, or ordered to be set, all those provisions before the three men, to feed upon, the cakes and butter, the milk and fatted calf: </p>
<p> and he stood by them under the tree ; not only to bid them welcome, but to minister to them; nor will this seem strange, or that the above several things were chiefly done by Abraham and Sarah, when it is observed that the greatest personages in the eastern countries, in early times, used to perform such services, and still do to this day, as a late travellerF18Dr. Shaw's Travels, p. 237, 238. Ed. 2.  informs us:&quot;it is here (says he) no disgrace for persons of the highest character to busy themselves in what we should reckon menial employments; the greatest prince assists in the most laborious actions of husbandry; neither is he ashamed to fetch a lamb from his herd and kill it, while the princess his wife is impatient till she has prepared her fire and her kettle to seethe and dress it: the custom that still continues of walking either barefoot or with slippers requires the ancient compliment of bringing water upon the arrival of a stranger to wash his feet; and who is the person that presents himself first to do this office, and to give the &quot;mar habbeh&quot;, or welcome, but the master of the family himself? who always distinguishes himself by being the most officious; and, after his entertainment is prepared, accounts it a breach of respect to sit down with his guests, but stands up all the time and serves them.'All which serves greatly to illustrate this passage; and the same learned author observes, that in this manner we find Achilles and Patroclus employed, as described by HomerF19Iliad. 9. ver. 205. , in providing an entertainment: </p>
<p> and they did eat ; or seemed to eat, as the Targum of Jonathan and Jarchi; though as they assumed bodies so animated as to be capable of talking and walking, why not of eating and drinking? and there must have been a consumption of food some way or other, or Abraham would have known they had not eaten: we read of angels' food, Psalm 78:25 ; our English poet had a notion of angels eating, and represents Eve providing a repast for the angel, which he owns to be no ungrateful foodF20Milton's Paradise Lost, B. 5. ver. 412, &c. . </p>

<p> and he said, behold, in the tent ; for in those times they dwelt in tents, and this was either the tent common to the family, or rather was Sarah's own tent, Genesis 24:67 ; Sarah was where she should be, in her own apartment, attending to the business of her family, and answered to the description the apostle gives of a good housewife, a keeper at home, Titus 2:5 ; </p>

<p>And he said ,.... The same that put the question, Jehovah himself, as appears by what follows: </p>
<p> I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life ; not by a personal appearance as now, but by the fulfilment of his promise which he had before given to Abraham, that he should have a son by Sarah, and now renews it; and this would be about the same time in the next year, perhaps at the spring of the year, which may be called &quot;a time of life&quot;, when all things revive, which in the winter season seem to be dead; a fit emblem this of the case and condition of Abraham and Sarah, both as they now were, and afterwards would be; for, though their bodies were as it were dead and unfit for generation, yet nature would revive in them again: unless it be understood of the whole time of the conception, quickening, and birth of an infant, at the usual time a woman goes with child, which is nine months, when the infant is a perfect living child. All the Targums paraphrase it,&quot;in which ye shall be alive,'safe and well, and so most of the Jewish commentators; as if it was a promise to Abraham and Sarah, that they should live to see the promise made good next given; but this seems not so agreeable as either of the former, see 2 Kings 4:16 , </p>
<p> and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son ; it was by degrees that this was made known to Abraham; first he was told he should have a son, but it was not said by whom he should have it; some years after that he is informed he should have a son by Sarah, but not when; but now it is revealed to him, that he should have one by her the next year: </p>
<p> and Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him ; or, &quot;and it was behind him&quot;F21&#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;  &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;   &quot;et ipsum post eum&quot;, Montanus. ; that is, the tent door was at the back of the person speaking; Sarah, hearing her name mentioned, got to the tent door to listen to what might be further said; and the place where she was, was behind the speaker, who stood between her and Abraham, with whom he was conversing; Abraham was before high, and Sarah behind him, so that he could not see her when she laughed, and yet he knew she did; and for the sake of that, this circumstance is remarked: both the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase the clause,&quot;and Ishmael stood behind it,'the tent door; and the former adds, and hearkened to what the angel said. </p>

<p> and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women ; her monthly visitors had left her, so that she was unfit for conception, and there could be no hope of it in a natural way; though the philosopherF23Aristot.

<p> shall I have pleasure ? in conception, or rather in having a son, and in suckling and nursing him, and bringing him up; for in bearing and bringing forth is sorrow: </p>

<p>And the Lord said ,.... The Targum of Jonathan adds, to the ministering angels, the two angels that were with him in the likeness of men; or to Abraham, at least in his hearing, by which he understood that Sodom and other cities were about to be destroyed for their sins: </p>
<p> because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great ; either of Lot in it, whose righteous soul was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked, and cried to heaven against them; or of the inhabitants that were oppressed by others, either in their bodies, being forced to submit to their unnatural usage of them, or in their estates, of which they wronged them; particularly the cry of the poor among them, whom they suffered to starve, though there were fulness of bread in the midst of them, see Ezekiel 16:49 ; the JewsF2Pirke Eliezer, c. 25.  say, they appointed false judges, who oppressed all strangers that came to Sodom, and made a law, that whoever relieved a poor person should be burnt with fire: or the cry of their sins, which were many and great, and openly and impudently committed; the cry of which came into the ears of the Lord of hosts, and called for vengeance. Those two cities, which perhaps were the greatest and the most remarkable for their sins, are put for all the five cities of the plain, called Pentapolis. </p>
<p> And because their sin is very grievous ; attended with very aggravated circumstances, they enjoyed great plenty of good things; and were not to be bore with, being so exceeding sinful, and so publicly and audaciously committed, especially that sin so frequent among them, which has its name from Sodom, see Genesis 13:13 . </p>

<p> shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  meaning the Lord, to whom he drew nigh, and was praying to, and pleading with, even the Son of God in human form, who, as he made the world, was the Governor of it and Judge in it; and indeed, as Mediator, has all judgment committed to him, and is appointed to be Judge of quick and dead at the last day, and who does all things that are just and equitable in Providence now; for there is no unrighteousness in him, nor in any of ways and works, and who will judge righteous judgment hereafter. Though by &quot;right&quot; Abraham seems to mean, not strict rigorous justice, but a mixture of mercy with justice, even moderation and clemency; for such are used by earthly judges, with whom it is a maxim, &quot;summum jus summa injuria&quot; (i.e. extreme law, extreme injustice); and therefore Abraham argues, surely the supreme Judge of all the earth will show mercy, and in the midst of deserved wrath remember it, and not deal according to the rules of inexorable and inflexible justice; and to this sense the answer of the Lord inclines. </p>

<p> and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom : not as a civil magistrate to try causes there, being appointed a judge over them, as Jarchi relates; yea, the Jews sayF9Bereshit Rabba, sect. 50. fol. 44. 4. : that that day five judges were appointed by the men of Sodom, and Lot was the chief of them; but this is not likely, and seems to be contradicted, Genesis 19:9 ; but he sat there to observe strangers that might pass by, and invite them into his house, and that they might not fall into the hands of the wicked Sodomites, who might abuse them; this being a time when not only travellers would be glad to put up and take refreshment, but his wicked neighbours lay in wait for them to satisfy their lusts on them: he had learnt this hospitality from Abraham: </p>
<p> and Lot seeing them, rose up to meet them : he arose from his seat and went forward to meet them, which showed his readiness and heartiness to receive them: </p>
<p> and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ; not in a religious way, as paying worship to angels, for as yet he did not know them to be such, and if he had, would not have given them divine adoration; but in a civil way, as was the custom of the eastern countries to bow very low in their civil respects to men, especially to great personages; and such Lot took these to be by their goodly looks and by their dress, as appears by his salutation of them in Genesis 19:2 . </p>

<p>And he said, behold now, my lords ,.... Taking them to be, and bespeaking them as persons of quality, who appeared with majesty in their countenances, and looked as if they had been well brought up, and were upon their travels; not knowing them to be angels, whom he received and entertained unawares, as the apostle, referring to Lot and Abraham, observes, Hebrews 13:2 , </p>
<p> turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house ; meaning himself, who was their humble servant, and entreats them to turn in to his house, which perhaps was hard by, and take up their lodging with him: the ancient JewsF11Bereshit Rabba, sect. 50. fol. 44. 4.  give the sense of the phrase thus, go a roundabout, winding, crooked way to my house, that the men of Sodom may not see you go in there, and know you are there. This is taken from the signification of the word to &quot;turn in&quot;, which in a different construction signifies to decline, to go back; and so the Targum of Jonathan,&quot;turn here, and there, and go into the house of your servant:&quot; </p>
<p> and tarry all night, and wash your feet ; the meaning is, that they would stay all night, and take up their lodging with him, when they had washed their feet, which was usually done before they laid down, and even before they supped; and indeed was the first thing that was done to a stranger upon his entering into the house, Genesis 18:4 , </p>
<p> and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways : signifying that he would not detain them longer than they thought fit; they might rise as soon in the morning as they pleased, and pursue their journey, only he entreats they would accept of a night's lodging with him: </p>
<p> and they said, nay, but we will abide in the street all night ; which they said partly out of modesty, it not becoming strangers to be too forward in accepting an invitation, and partly to try whether Lot was hearty in the invitation he gave them; and hereby also reigning ignorance of the manners and behaviour of the men of Sodom, as if they might be safe from their insults in the street in the night; and this made Lot the more pressing upon them, that they might not be exposed to his wicked neighbours. </p>

<p> and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house : went along with him to it, and instead of proceeding forward, or continuing where they were, or steering their course to a street in the city, they turned in to Lot's house: </p>
<p> and he made them a feast ; a large, liberal, and generous entertainment, as Abraham did, consisting of a variety of eatables and drinkables; indeed it has its name only from drinking, wine being a principal part of a banquet: </p>
<p> and did bake unleavened bread ; not because it was the time of the passover, as Jarchi suggests, for as yet that was not instituted; but for quicker dispatch, that his guests might have their supper the sooner, and get to bed the earlier, and rest themselves; bread without leaven in it being sooner baked than that which is made with it: </p>

<p> the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round about ; the house of Lot, where the angels were: </p>
<p> both old and young : the males of the city of every age; some that were past committing the sin they were so infamous for, as well as those that burned with that unnatural lust; some that could not be actors were willing to be spectators; and all were curious to see the lovely persons, that it was reported all over the city were seen to go into Lot's house: </p>
<p> all the people from every quarter ; all from one end of the city to the other, and from every corner in it: which shows the general corruption and depravity of the city, that it was so far from having ten righteous persons in it, that of the proper inhabitants of it, there was not, as Jarchi notes, one righteous person, no, not one. </p>

<p> and said unto him, where are the men which came in to thee this night ? for though they were angels, they appeared like men, and they seemed to be so to them who saw them go into Lot's house: </p>
<p> bring them out unto us, that we may know them ; not who they were, and from whence they came, and what their business was; nor did they pretend anything of this kind to hide and cover their design from Lot, but they were open and impudent, and declared their sin without shame and blushing, which is their character, Isaiah 3:9 ; their meaning was, that they might commit that unnatural sin with them, they were addicted to, and in common used, and which from them to this day bears the name of Sodomy. As lawful copulation with a man's wife is modestly expressed by knowing her, Genesis 4:1 ; so this unlawful and shocking copulation of man with man is expressed by this phrase; and that this was their meaning is plain from Lot's answer to them, Genesis 19:8 . </p>

<p> let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes ; this was a very great evil in Lot to make such an offer of his daughters; it was contrary to parental love and affection, an exposing the chastity of his daughters, which should have been his care to preserve; nor had he a power to dispose of them in such a manner: and though fornication is a lesser evil than sodomy, yet all evil is to be avoided, and even it is not to be done that good may come: nothing can be said to excuse this good man, but the hurry of spirit, and confusion of mind that he was in, not knowing what to say or do to prevent the base designs of those men; that he might be pretty certain they would not accept of his offer, their lust burning more after men than women; that this showed his great regard to the laws of hospitality, that he had rather sacrifice his daughters to their brutal lusts, than give up the men that were in his house to them; and that he might hope that this would soften their minds, and put them off of any further attempt; but after all it must be condemned as a dangerous and imprudent action: </p>
<p> only unto these men do nothing ; for as yet he knew them not to be angels; had he, it would not have given him the concern it did, since he must have known that they were able to defend themselves, and that the sin these men offered to commit could not be perpetrated on them: but he took them for mere men, and his request is, that no injury might be done to their persons in any respect, and especially in that way which their wicked hearts put them upon, and is so shocking to nature: </p>
<p> for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof ; for though it was not their intention in coming, nor the design of Providence in bringing them into Lot's house, to secure them from the violence of the men of Sodom, but for the preservation of Lot and his family, which as yet he knew nothing of, yet it was what Lot had in view in giving the invitation to them: and the laws of hospitality being reckoned sacred and inviolable, a man's house was accounted an asylum for strangers when taken into it. </p>

<p>And they said, stand back ,.... Turn on one side, get away from the door, that we may come to it: </p>
<p> and they said again : to one another: </p>
<p> this one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge ; this one man, and he a stranger and sojourner, no freeman or citizen of this city, sets himself against the whole body of the inhabitants, and takes upon him to judge what is right and wrong to be done; and if he is let alone in &quot;judging he will judge&quot;F13&#1497;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;  &#1513;&#1508;&#1493;&#1496;   &quot;judicabit judicando&quot;, Drusius. , as it may be rendered; he will take upon him this office, and continue to exercise it, and determine and decide all matters among us at his pleasure. This confutes the above notion of the Jews, that Lot was appointed a judge by the men of Sodom, yea, the president of the court for that day; See Gill on Genesis 19:1 , </p>
<p> now will we deal worse with thee than with them : the men in his house, both by abusing his body in their unnatural way, and by beating and bruising him, and pulling him in pieces, limb from limb; something of this kind they seem to threaten him with, and attempted to effect, as follows: </p>
<p> and they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot ; not only with words in a bullying way, with menaces and threats, with oaths, and curses, and imprecations; for it is the same word that is used of Lot, pressing the angels with words and arguments to come into his house, Genesis 19:3 ; but they rushed in upon him in a body, and pushed him away, and pulled him about, and would in all probability have torn him to pieces, had he not been rescued by the angels: </p>
<p> and came near to break the door : that which was shut, the door of the passage that led to the house. </p>

<p> and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door ; and thus they rescued Lot from the fury and rage of the men of Sodom, and prevented his daughters being exposed unto them, as he had offered. This action showed them to be more than men, that they should open the door, take in Lot, and shut it so suddenly, that the men of Sodom could take no advantage of it, could neither retain Lot, nor enter the door when opened, and especially what follows. </p>

The word for &quot;blindness&quot; is only used here and in 2 Kings 6:18 , and denotes a peculiar sort of blindness; not an entire blindness with respect to every object, but only with regard to that they were intent upon; for otherwise they would not have continued about Lot's house, or fatigued themselves with searching for the door of it, but would rather have been glad to have groped to their own houses as well as they could: and thus it was with the Syrians, when they were smitten at the prayer of Elisha, it was not total, for they could follow the prophet in the way he went and led them, but they could not see their way to the place where they intended to go; and so these men of Sodom could see other objects, but not the door of Lot's house, their heads were so confused, and their imaginations so disturbed as in drunken men; or the medium of the visive faculty, the air, so altered, or the form of the object to be seen so changed, that they could not discern it; when they saw the door, it looked like the wall, and that which seemed to them to be the door, proved to be the wall: </p>
<p> so that they wearied themselves to find the door ; went backwards and forwards, fancying the door was here, and then it was there, and when they came to it, they perceived it was not; and thus they went to and fro, until they were quite weary of seeking it, and despaired of finding it, and left off. </p>

<p>And Lot went out ,.... From his house, after the men of Sodom were gone from it, and before the morning, very probably about midnight: </p>
<p> and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters : according to Aben Ezra, he had two other daughters that perished in Sodom, which he gathers from Genesis 19:15 , &quot;which are here&quot;, as if he had some elsewhere; and so Jarchi says, he had two daughters married in the city. And the Jewish writersF17Pirke Eliezer, c. 25.  speak of one of them, whose name was Pelothith, married to one of the grandees of Sodom: but it seems rather, that these were the daughters Lot had at home with him; who, according to JosephusF18Antiqu. l. 1. c. 11. sect. 4.  were espoused to men in the city, but not yet married; and on account of such espousals, as were usual in the eastern countries, Lot calls them his sons-in-law, as they were intended, and so the words may be rendered, &quot;that were about to take his daughters&quot;F19&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1497;  &#1489;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;   &quot;qui brevi fuerant ducturi filias suas&quot;, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator; so some in Vatablus & Drusius. ; to take them for wives, and to their own houses, neither of which they had as yet done; for if these had been daughters of his married, and taken home, he would not only have spoke unto their husbands, but to them also; and would have been still more pressing upon them to arise and make their escape; of which nothing is said, nor of any answer of theirs to him, only of his sons-in-law, as they are called on the above account: </p>
<p> and said, up, get ye out of this place ; that is, get up from your beds, anne immediately, and make your escape out of the city: </p>
<p> for the Lord will destroy this city ; now, directly, immediately; therefore there is no time to be lost, but at once prepare for your safety: </p>

<p> then the angels hastened Lot ; urged him to get out of his house as fast as he could: </p>
<p> saying, arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here ; from whence Aben Ezra, and others, have concluded, as has been observed, that he had other daughters elsewhere, which they suppose were married to men of Sodom; but the phrase, &quot;which are here&quot;, or &quot;are found&quot;, or &quot;are present&quot;F20&#1492;&#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;   &quot;quae inveniuntur&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus; &quot;quae adsunt&quot;, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator; &quot;quae praesentes&quot;, Fagius, Munster, Cocceius. , relates to his wife, as well as his daughters, and only signifies, that he should take all his relations that were present; and these may be only opposed to and distinguished from his sons-in-law that were absent, and refused to hearken to his advice and exhortations. Onkelos paraphrases the words, &quot;who are found faithful with thee&quot;; who believed what the angels said concerning the destruction of Sodom, as well as he, as did his wife and two daughters: </p>

<p> the Lord being merciful unto him ; and so saved them from the ruin and destruction of the city, in which had they stayed a little longer they would have been involved. It was not owing to their merits, but to the mercy of God that they were spared: </p>

<p> look not behind thee ; as showing any concern for his goods and substance he had left behind him, or for his sons-in-law, who refused to come with him, and much less for the wicked inhabitants of the city; and this command was not given to Lot only, but to his wife and daughters, as appears by the sequel: </p>
<p> neither stay thou in all the plain : in the plain of Jordan, for the whole plain, and the cities in it, were to be destroyed: </p>

<p>Then the Lord rained upon Sodom, and upon Gomorrah, brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.  And not upon those two cities only, but upon Admah and Zeboiim also, see Deuteronomy 29:23 ; this was not a common storm of thunder and lightning, with which often there is a smell of sulphur or brimstone; but this was a continued shower of sulphurous fire, or of burning flaming brimstone, which at once consumed those cities and the inhabitants of them; and the land adjacent being bituminous, or however some parts of it, full of slimepits, or pits of bitumen, a liquid of a pitchy quality, Genesis 14:10 ; this flaming sulphur falling thereon, must burn in a most fierce and furious manner; and which utterly consumed not only houses, goods, and everything upon the land, but the land itself, and turned it into a bituminous lake, called to this day, from thence, the Lake Asphaltites, the Greek word for bitumen being &quot;asphaltos&quot;. Of this conflagration some Heathen writers speak, as particularly TacitusF6Hist. l. 5. c. 7.  who says, some large and famous cities, or, as some copies have it, Jewish ones, not far from Jordan, were struck with thunderbolts, and were fired &quot;igni ceolesti&quot;, with fire from heaven, and were consumed; and so SolinusF7Polyhistor. c. 48.  relates, that,&quot;at some distance from Jerusalem, a sorrowful lake appears, which the black ground testifies was stricken by heaven and turned into ashes; where were two towns, the one called Sodomum, the other Gomorrum.'This was a righteous judgment on those cities, and a just retaliation for their sin; their sin was an unnatural one, and nature is inverted to punish them, fire comes down from heaven, or hell from heaven, as Salvian's words are, to consume them; they burned with lusts one against another, and flaming sheets of sulphurous fire fall upon them, burn and destroy them; and, in allusion to this terrible conflagration, hell is called the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, Judges 1:7   Revelation 20:14 ; and this destruction was brought upon them by Jehovah the Son of God, who had appeared to Abraham in an human form, and gave him notice of it, and heard all he had to plead for those cities, and then departed from him to Sodom, and was the author of this sad catastrophe; this amazing shower of fire and brimstone was rained by him from Jehovah his Father, out of heaven; so the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem both call him, the Word of the Lord. </p>

Of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim: very probably at the same time that this fiery tempest was in the heavens, there was an earthquake which overthrew the cities; and so StraboF8Geograph. l. 16. p. 526.  makes the lake, which is now the place where they stood, to be owing to earthquakes and eruptions of fire, and of hot bituminous and sulphurous waters; and says nothing of fire from heaven, which yet Tacitus and Solinus do, being unacquainted with the sacred history: </p>
<p> and all the plain ; the plain of Jordan, and the cities on it, all but Zoar; not all the five cities, as JosephusF9De Bello Jud. l. 4. c. 8. sect. 4. : EgesippusF11De excidio urb. l. 4. c. 18.  and other authors mistake, only the four above mentioned.

<p> and all the inhabitants of the cities ; none were spared, all were destroyed, but Lot, his wife, and two daughters: </p>
<p> and that which grew upon the ground ; the trees, herbs, and plants; these were all turned up by the earthquake, and burnt with fire from heaven: Tacitus, in his account of this conflagration, says,&quot;the fields, which were formerly fruitful, and inhabited by many cities, were burnt up with lightning; and there are traces (he adds) yet remain; the earth itself looks torrid, and has lost its fruitful virtue; for whatsoever grows up of itself, or is sown and rises up in the plant or flower, or grows up to its usual species, becomes black and empty, and vanishes into ashes.'The place where those cities stood is now a lake, and is sometimes called the salt sea, Genesis 14:3 ; and sometimes the dead sea, because it is said, no creature can live in it; and sometimes called the Lake Asphaltites, from its bituminous and pitchy quality: though RelandF15Palestina illustrata, tom. 1. l. 1. c. 38. p. 254, &c.  has attempted to confute the notion that the cities of Sodom, &c. stood where this lake now is: and the many things that have been reported of this lake and parts adjacent, by various historians, supposed to be of good credit, are by modern travellers explodedF16Vid.

Ed. 5. , though he questions some of the above things before related, especially concerning the apples, yet says,&quot;not far from thence grows a tree whose fruit is like a green walnut, which he saw, and which they say never ripens.'This lake of Sodom, according to JosephusF20Ut supra. (De Bello Jud. l. 4. c. 8. sect. 4.) , is five hundred and eighty furlongs in length unto Zoar, and one hundred fifty broad; but, according to modern accounts, it is twenty four leagues in length, and six or seven in breadthF21Universal History, ib. p. 424. See Egmont, &c. ib, p. 342. ; the Arabic geographerF23Scherif Ibn Idris, apud Reland. ib. p. 249.  says, it is sixty miles in length, and twelve in breadth; it is now called by the Arabs, Bahar Louth, Lot's lake. </p>

<p>But his wife looked back from behind him ,.... That is, the wife of Lot, whose name the Jewish writersF24Pirke Eliezer, c. 25.  say was Adith, or as others IrithF25Baal Hatturim in loc. ; and, according to the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem, she was a native of Sodom: now, as they were going from Sodom to Zoar, she was behind Lot, his back was to her, so that he could not see her; this was a temptation to her to look back, since her husband could not see her; and this she did, either, as the above paraphrases suggest, that she might see what would be the end of her father's house and family, or whether her married daughters, if she had any, were following her, after whom her bowels yearned; or being grieved for the goods and substance left behind, and for the people of Sodom in general, for whom she had too much concern; however, be it on what account it may, she was severely punished for it: </p>
<p> and she became a pillar of salt ; was struck dead at once, either by the immediate hand of God, or by the shower of fire and brimstone; and her body was at once changed into a metallic substance, a kind of salt, hard and durable, such as PlinyF26Nat. Hist. l. 31. c. 7.  speaks of, cut out of rocks, with which houses were built, and hardened with the sun, and could scarcely be cut with an iron instrument; so that she did not fall to the ground, but stood up erect as a pillar, retaining very probably the human form, JosephusF1Antiqu. l. 1. c. 11. sect. 4.  says, this pillar continued to his times, and that he saw it; IrenaeusF2Adv. Haeres. l. 4. c. 51.  and TertullianF3In Carmine Sodoma.  speak of it as in their times, a thing incredible; and Benjamin of Tudela saysF4ltinerarium, p. 44. , it stood in his times two parsas from the sea of Sodom; and though the flocks were continually licking it, yet it grew again to its former size. RauwolffF5Travels, par. 3. c. 21. p. 313. by Ray.  relates something of the same kind by information, but not on his own testimony; that the pilgrims who visit it used to beat off some small pieces, and yet was found whole again; nay, which is beyond all credit, that they once knocked off a whole hand and took it away, and when they returned found it whole again: and oneF6Baumgarten. Peregrinatio, l. 3. c. 12. p. 96.  that travelled in those parts in the beginning of the sixteenth century affirms, that almost in the midway to Zoar is seen to this day the pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was turned; he does not say indeed that he saw it, but leaves his reader to think so; and the Jerusalem Targum says, it will remain until the resurrection; but modern travellers of credit and intelligence could never see it; and when they have inquired of the country people about it, they either tell them there is no such thing, or say it stands in the mountains, where it cannot be come at, because of the Arabs, or because of wild beastsF7Universal History, ib. p. 124. Witsii Miscellan. Sacr. tom. 2. p. 195. : but no doubt there was such a statue, but how long it continued cannot be said; nor should it be thought incredible, when there are similar facts affirmed by authors of the best credit and reputation: AventinusF8Annal. Bojor. apud Heidegger. Hist. Patriarch. tom. 2. exercitat. 8. p. 270. & Witsii Miscellan. tom. 2. exercitat. 7. p. 201.  reports, that in Bavaria, in 1348, more than fifty peasants, with the cows they had milked, at the time of an earthquake were struck with a pestilential air, and stiffened into statues of salt, and which he himself saw, and the chancellor of Austria: and Bisselius relatesF9Argonaut. Americ. l. 14. c. 2. apud Witsium, ib. p. 202. , that Didacus Almagrus, who was the first person that with his army penetrated through the cold countries from Peru into Chile, lost abundance of his men, through the extremity of the cold and a pestiferous air; and that, returning to the same place five months afterwards, he found his men, horse and foot, standing unmoved, unconsumed, in the same situation, form, and habit, the pestilence had fastened them; one lying on the ground, another standing upright, another holding his bridle in his hand, as if about to shake it; in short, he found them just as he left them, without any ill smell or colour, common to corpses: indeed, the very fables of the Heathens, which seem to be hammered out of this history, serve to confirm the truth of the whole of it: as the fable of Jupiter and Mercury coming to a certain place in Phrygia, where they were hospitably entertained by Baucis and Philemon, when the doors were shut against them by others; wherefore they directed their guests, after being entertained by them, to leave the place and follow them to the mountains, when they turned the town into a standing lakeF11Ovid. Metamorph. l. 8. fab. 8. : and also that of Niobe being changed into a marble stone while weeping for the death of her children: and of Olenus and Lethaea, turned into stones alsoF12Ib. l. 6. fab. 4. & l. 10. fab. 1. Apollodor. de Deorum Orig. l. 3. p. 146. . But, leaving these, and passing by other instances that might be observed, we are directed to remember this wonderful case by our Lord himself, Luke 17:32 ; and it should be an instruction to us not to look back nor turn back from the profession of the true religion we have made, but to follow Christ, and abide by his truths and ordinances. </p>

<p> and dwelt in the mountain ; which the Lord had directed him to go to before, but was unwilling, and chose Zoar, and desired he might flee thither, and that that might be spared; but now he likes God's advice for him better than his own, and therefore betook himself to the mountain, where he might think himself safest, and where he continued; very probably this was the mountain Engaddi, under which Zoar is said to lie by AdrichomiusF14Theatrum Terrae S. p. 54. : </p>

<p>And the firstborn said unto the younger ,.... That is, the firstborn of those two, or the elder of them; for, if Lot had other daughters that were married in Sodom, it is probable they were elder than either of these: Aben Ezra intimates, that Lot had another wife, who died first, and these were by his second; the following motion is made by the eldest of them to the youngest, as being bolder, having more authority, and a greater influence to persuade: </p>
<p> our father is old ; if he was fifty years of age when he was taken captive by the kings, as says the Jewish chronologerF17Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 77. 1.  he must now be sixty five, since the destruction of Sodom, according to Bishop UsherF18Annales Vet. Test. p. 8,9. , was fifteen years after that: </p>
<p> and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth ; to marry them, cohabit with them, and procreate children of them, which was the common way of the propagation of mankind in the earth; they thought the whole world was destroyed by fire, as it had been by a flood; they understood it would be no more consumed by water, but they had been told it would be by fire, and they imagined the time was now come, and this was the case; that not only Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by fire, and that by this time the fire had reached to Zoar, and had consumed that, but that the whole earth was destroyed, and not a man left but their father, and therefore thought it could be excusable in them, and lawful for them to take the following method to repopulate the world; or else they supposed there were none in the land, the land of Canaan, not of any of their kindred and relations, for they might be ignorant of Abraham and his family, or however of any good man that they knew of, that they could be joined to in marriage; for as for the inhabitants of Zoar, they had just left, they were as wicked as any, and therefore could not think of living with them in such a near relation: but all this is not a sufficient excuse for contriving and executing what is after related; for they should have inquired of their father, who could have informed them better. </p>

<p>Come, let us make our father drink wine ,.... Meaning to excess, so as to be inebriated with it, and not know what he did: this wine might be brought with them from Sodom, with other provisions for their refreshment and support; or it may be rather from Zoar, where they furnished themselves with a quantity for their support in the mountain they betook themselves unto: </p>
<p> and we will lie with him, that we may preserve the seed of our father ; have children by him, and propagate and preserve the human species; this they might think lawful, such incestuous copulations being usual among their neighbours the Arabs, as appears from StraboF19Geograph. l. 16. p. 538. Vid. Pocock, Specim. Arab. Hist. p. 337, 338.  and other writers, and especially when there seemed to them to be a necessity for it; and it may be this did not arise from a spirit of uncleanness, or a brutish lust prevailing in them, having been religiously educated, and having preserved their chastity among such an impure generation as the men of Sodom: wherefore this might rather arise, as Bishop Patrick and others have thought, from an eager desire after the Messiah, they might hope would spring from them; their father being a descendant of Shem, a son of Abraham's elder brother, and now remarkably saved from Sodom, which they might conclude was for this purpose; and they knew of no way in which it could be brought about but in this they proposed; and the rather this may be thought to be their view, as the above learned commentator observes, when we remark their former chaste life in Sodom; their joining together in this contrivance, which, had it been a lustful business, they would have been ashamed to have communicated their thoughts of it to one another; and their imposition of names on their children to perpetuate the memory of this fact, which they rather gloried in, than were ashamed of: to which may be added, that the ancient Jewish writersF20Bereshit Rabba, sect. 51. fol. 46. 1. Midrash Ruth, fol. 35. 4.  interpret this of the Messiah; and they observe,&quot;it is not said a son, but seed, that seed, which is he that comes from another place: and what is this? this is the King Messiah:'and Ruth, the Moabitess, who was of the race of the eldest daughter of Lot, stands in the genealogy of our Lord, Matthew 1:5 , however, let the intention be ever so good, it will, not justify an action so monstrously vile. </p>

<p>And they made their father drink wine that night ,....

There is an extraordinary prick on the Vau in Kumah, rendered &quot;she arose&quot;, which the Jews sayF21T. Bab.

We learn from hence what the best of men are when left to themselves; a good man, a righteous Lot, is guilty of crimes the most shocking; he exposed the chastity of his daughters to the men of Sodom, and now his daughters attacked him, and succeeded, being both with child by him; and this brought about by excessive drinking, a sin which often leads on to the foulest crimes, and therefore to be carefully avoided; these sins Lot fell into when as it were alone, on a mountain, in a cave, none but his family with him, and these only his two daughters; he that had stood his ground in the midst of Sodom, notwithstanding all the excesses of that place, the impurities in it, and the temptations that every day offered, now falls when seemingly out of the way of all: these sins and failings of good men are recorded for our admonition and caution, that we may shun all appearance of evil, and be careful lest we fall, and neither be presumptuous not self-confident, see 1 Corinthians 10:12 . </p>

<p> the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day ; a people that lived near their brethren the Moabites, and were both enemies to the people of God; they quickly falling into idolatry, and whose names we often meet with in the sacred writings; and of these two sons, Josephus saysF24Antiqu. l. 1. c. 11. sect. 5. , the one begat the Moabites, being still a great nation, and the other the Ammonites, and both inhabit Coelesyria; they are both called the children of Lot, Psalm 83:8 .

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 20  </p>
<p> This chapter relates the removal of Abraham to Gerar, Genesis 20:1 ; the king of Gerar's taking to him Sarah, whom Abraham had called his sister, Genesis 20:2 ; who is rebuked of God for it in a dream, Genesis 20:3 ; for which he makes an apology that is admitted, only he is ordered to restore to Abraham his wife, Genesis 20:4 ; and accordingly early in the morning he called his servants, and acquainted them with what had happened, Genesis 20:8 ; and then sent for Abraham, and expressed his resentment at his usage of him, Genesis 20:9 ; which Abraham defended as well as he could, Genesis 20:10 ; the issue of all which was, great kindness was shown to Abraham, and his wife restored to him, though with a reproof to her from the king, Genesis 20:14 ; upon which Abraham prayed for the healing of Abimelech and his family, in which he was heard and answered, Genesis 20:17 . </p>

<p>And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country ,.... He returned from the plains or oaks of Mamre, where he had lived fifteen or twenty years, into the more southern parts of the land of Canaan: the reason of this remove is not certain; some think, because he could not bear the stench of the sulphurous lake, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were become; and others, because of the scandal of Lot's incest with his daughters, which prejudiced the idolatrous people in those parts more against the true religion; neither of which are likely, by reason of the distance; but the better reason seems to be, that it was so ordered in Providence that he should remove from place to place, that it might appear that he was but a sojourner in the land: </p>
<p> and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur ; two wildernesses, as Jerom saysF25De loc. Heb. fol, 91. I. , one of which joined to Egypt, to which the people of Israel went when they passed over the Red sea, and the other, Kadesh, reached to the desert of the Saracens. Onkelos and Jonathan paraphrase the words between Rekam and Chagra, or Hagra, the same place where the angel of the Lord met with Hagar at the well; see Gill on Genesis 16:7   and See Gill on Genesis 16:14 , </p>
<p> and sojourned in Gerar ; or Gerara, as JeromF26De loc. Heb. fol. 91. I.  calls it,&quot;from whence he says the Geraritic country in his time beyond Daroma, or the south, had its name, and was twenty five miles distance from Eleutheropolis to the south, and was formerly the southern border of the Canaanites, and the metropolis of Palestine.'According to the Samaritan version, Gerar is the same with Ashkelon, which was afterwards, when aristocracy took place in this country, one of the five lordships of the Philistines; and so says AfricanusF1Apud Syncell. Chronic. p. 100. ; and that Gerar was in the country of the Philistines, and Abimelech was king of them, is clear from Genesis 21:32 . This place was about six miles from MamreF2Bunting's Travels, p. 57. , from whence Abraham removed. </p>

<p>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister ,.... This he gave out in all conversation he came into, and said it to every one that asked who she was, which was little better than a lie; it at least was an equivocation and deception, and not at all justifiable, and tended to expose his wife's chastity, and discovered a distrust of divine Providence; the same infirmity be had given way to, and the same evil he had fallen into in Egypt, Genesis 12:11 , and therefore was the more inexcusable now; good men not only fall into sin, but have their relapses: </p>
<p> and Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah ; having heard or seen what a beautiful woman. Sarah was, though ninety years of age, having never bore children; and understanding she was a single person, sent his servants to take her, and bring her to his house, in order to be his wife, which seems to be done with some kind of force; and it can hardly be thought that Abraham and Sarah would freely agree to it, at least it must be done with reluctance on their parts. Whether Abimelech was the first king of Palestine of this name, is not certain; if he was, which is not improbable, it became usual afterwards for the kings thereof to be so called, as Pharaoh was a common name to the kings of Egypt; it signifies &quot;father&quot; and &quot;king&quot;, as kings should be the fathers of their people. </p>

<p>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night ,.... Put a dream into his mind, by which he cautioned him against taking Sarah to be his wife; so careful was the Lord that no wrong should be done to such a godly and virtuous person, to which she was exposed through the weakness of her husband. Aben Ezra wrongly interprets this of an angel, when it was God himself: </p>
<p> and said unto him, behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken ; that is, God would punish him with death, unless he restored the woman, whom he had taken, to her husband; not for any uncleanness he had committed with her, but for taking her without her free and full consent, and without inquiring more strictly into her relation to Abraham, and connection with him, and for his impure and unlawful desires after her, if persisted in: </p>
<p> for she is a man's wife , or &quot;married to an husband&quot;F3&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;  &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;   &quot;maritata marito&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, Piscator, Schmidt. ; and therefore it was unlawful in him to take her to be his wife. </p>

<p>But Abimelech had not come near her ,.... Sarah had been put into an apartment in his palace, and not yet admitted into his company, not at least to his bed; he had not lain with her, which is the design of the expression: the Septuagint version is, &quot;had not touched her&quot;, as in Genesis 20:6 ; which is another phrase expressive of the same thing: </p>
<p> and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ? meaning either his family, the greater part of which were not accessory to this affair; or rather his kingdom, as Aben Ezra, see Genesis 20:9 ; which though not a nation of righteous men, in a strict sense, see Genesis 20:11 ; yet with regard to this business of Sarah were no ways criminal: either God had threatened to destroy his people, as well as himself, if he did not return Sarah to her husband, or committed iniquity with her; or he knew that this had been usual for people to suffer for the crimes of their governors, and like a true father of his country shows an affectionate concern for their welfare in the first place; for this may be the sense of the word &quot;also&quot;, on which an emphasis is put; wilt thou not only slay me, but also a whole nation for my sake, a nation free from all fault and blame in this matter? though some think he has reference to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, a recent action, and fresh in his mind; as if he should say, thou hast justly destroyed a wicked people for their sins, and wilt thou also destroy a nation that at least, in comparison of them, is a just and righteous one? </p>

<p>Said he not unto me, she is my sister ?.... By this it appears, that Abimelech had a personal conversation with Abraham, and inquired of him about Sarah, who she was, and what relation she was to him, who told him that she was his sister; and for the truth of this he appeals to the omniscient God, who knew that Abraham had told him this: </p>
<p> and she, even she herself said, he is my brother ; when Sarah was asked what relation she stood in to Abraham, and he to her, she declared he was her brother; so that Abimelech had reason to conclude, from what both of them had said, that this was the truth of the matter, and especially from what Sarah said, who he thought might be depended on, and would speak out the whole truth on such an occasion: </p>
<p> in the integrity of my heart, and innocency of my hands, have I done this ; hereby declaring, that his design was not to defile the woman, and to gratify his lust, but to take her to be his wife; and this he thought to be no evil, though he had a wife, Genesis 20:17 ; polygamy not being reckoned a sin in those times; and that he had used no violence in taking her, they both seemingly agreeing to it. </p>

<p> yea , or &quot;also&quot; </p>
<p> I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart ; not only thou knowest, but I, who know all things, know and acknowledge that this was so done by thee. Abimelech's plea is admitted, and a very great testimony borne to his integrity in this matter; and throughout the whole account he appears to be a man of great honour and uprightness, especially in this affair, if not a good man: </p>
<p> for I also withheld thee from sinning against me ; for had he committed adultery with her, it had been not only a sin against her, and against her husband, but against God being contrary to his will revealed in the minds of men by the law and light of nature, before the law of Moses was given: and indeed all sin against the neighbour is ultimately against God, see Psalm 51:4 ; and now from the commission of this sin God restrained Abimelech, either by some impulse upon his mind not to take her to be his wife as yet, or by throwing some thing or other in the way of it, in his providence, or by inflicting some disease upon him, which rendered him incapable of it, Genesis 20:17 , </p>
<p> therefore suffered I thee not to touch her ; that is, to have carnal knowledge of her, see 1 Corinthians 7:1 ; as there is nothing done but what is done by divine permission, so many more evils would be committed than there are, were it not that men are restrained from them by the power and providence of God, not suffering them to do them; and in particular this sin was prevented, that it might not in any respect be a doubtful point whether Isaac, whom Sarah had now conceived, was a legitimate son of Abraham; and these expressions of Abimelech not coming near her, Genesis 20:4 ; and not touching her as here, are used for that purpose. </p>

<p>Now therefore restore the man his wife ,.... Which will be a full proof and evidence to all of the integrity of thy heart, and the innocence of thine hands, which thou pleadest, and which I own: </p>
<p> for he is a prophet ; familiar with God, dear unto him, a friend of his, to whom he communicates his secrets; is able to foretell things to come, as well as to interpret the mind of God, and instruct in the knowledge of divine things, all which agrees with Abraham's character; and he is the first man that is dignified in Scripture with the title of a prophet; so he is called in the Apocrypha:&quot;Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy father's tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.' (Tobit 4:12)Jarchi thinks this is observed to encourage Abimelech to return his wife to him, because being a prophet he knew he had not touched her, and therefore would receive her more readily, and entertain no ill opinion of her; but rather it is mentioned for the reason following: </p>
<p> and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live ; it being one part of the business of a prophet to pray for others, and make intercession for them, especially in any distress or trouble, see Jeremiah 27:18 . Prophets were praying persons, had usually a great gift in prayer, and great power with God, and prevailed with him for the good of others; and such an one was Abraham; and it is here intimated, that upon the restoration of his wife to him, as he was familiar with God, and had an interest with him, he would make use of it, and pray for Abimelech, that whatsoever offence he had been guilty of to God or men, it might be forgiven, and that he might be healed of the disease with which he was smitten, and so recover of it, and live in health and happiness: </p>
<p> and if thou restore her not, know thou, that thou shalt surely die ,  </p>
<p> thou, and all that are thine : if he proceeded to take her to be his wife, and defile her, he is strongly assured that he should die, death being the punishment for adultery before the law of Moses, see Genesis 38:24 ; and not only he, but all his family, especially such who had been, or would be accessory to this affair, and even all who might he justly punished of God for other sins they had committed; and Abimelech being punished, both in his own person, and in his servants and subjects, the greater his punishment was, the greater abhorrence and detestation was shown to the sin he would be guilty of, to deter him from which this threatening is given out. </p>

<p> and called all his servants ; his household servants, and particularly his courtiers and counsellors, who had advised him to take Sarah for his wife, and had been assisting in it: </p>
<p> and told all those things in their ears : how that God appeared to him in a dream, and told him that Sarah, whom he had taken into his house, was another man's wife, and that if he did not immediately return her to her husband, he would die, and all that belonged to him: </p>

<p> and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me, and on my kingdom, a great sin ? the sin of adultery, he had been in danger of committing, which by the light of nature was known and acknowledged to be a great sin, and therefore was avoided by Heathens, and prohibited and punished by them; or else a &quot;great punishment&quot;F4&#1492;&#1496;&#1488;&#1492;  &#1490;&#1491;&#1500;&#1492;   &quot;noxam magnam&quot;, Junius & Tremellius; &quot;poenam peccati&quot;, Menochius; so Abendana. , as death to him, and all his subjects: and now Abimelech expostulates with him, and desires to know what he had done to incur his displeasure, that he should take such a method as this to avenge himself of him; he plainly intimates that he was not conscious to himself that he had done any thing to offend him; he had suffered him to come into his kingdom, and sojourn in it, and used him well, and in no instance, as he knew of, had done anything to affront him: </p>
<p> thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done ; in saying Sarah was his sister, and persuading her to say the same, and so virtually disowning his marriage with her, equivocating in this affair, and dissembling truth, and thereby exposing the chastity of his wife, and the king to the commission of sin with her; things that ought not to be done by any man, and much less by a man professing religion and godliness. </p>

<p> and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken ; which intends the same thing in different words; and the repetition is made to cause attention to God's fulfilment of his promise, who is always faithful to his word, even in things very difficult and seemingly impossible, as in the present case: hence the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase it, God did a wonder or wonders for Sarah in causing her to conceive when she was so old, and in such circumstances as she was. </p>

<p>And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh ,.... This she said on occasion of the name of her son Isaac, which name her husband had given him by divine direction, and to which she assented. This doubtless brought to her mind her former laughing, when she first heard that she should have a son, which was in a way of diffidence and distrust; but now God having given her a son, laid a foundation for laughter of another kind, for real, solid, joy and thankfulness: </p>
<p> so that all that hear will laugh with me ; not laugh at her, and deride her, as Piscator interprets it; but congratulate her, and rejoice with her on this occasion, as on a like one the neighbours of Elisabeth did with her, Luke 1:58 . </p>

<p>And she said, who would have said unto Abraham ,.... No one a year ago could ever have thought of such a thing, much less have come and told Abraham that he should have a child or children by Sarah; the thing was incredible, and next to impossible; none but God himself, or an angel from him, could have declared this, as none but he could bring it about, the thing is so marvellous and astonishing: </p>
<p> that Sarah should have given children suck ? that she who was ninety years of age should bear a child, and suckle it, as she did; and in doing which she set an example to her daughters to do the like, since neither age nor grandeur, nor the business of her family, were any objection to this duty of nature; and her being able to do this was a clear proof that this was truly a child of her own. The plural number may be put for the singular, as it often is, see Genesis 46:23 ; or Sarah might think, as she had strength given her to bear and suckle one child, she might bear and suckle more; though the phrase seems only to be expressive and descriptive of her as a nursing mother: </p>

<p>And the child grew, and was weaned ,.... He throve under the nursing of its mother, and through the blessing of God upon him; and being healthy and robust, and capable of digesting stronger food, and living upon it, he was weaned from the breast: at what age Isaac was when weaned is not certain, there being no fixed time for such an affair, but it was at the discretion of parents, and as they liked it, and the case of their children required; and in those times, when men lived to a greater age than now, they might not be weaned so early, as we find their marrying and begetting children were when they were more advanced in years. The Jewish writers are not agreed about this matter. Jarchi and Ben Melech say that Isaac was weaned twenty four months after his birth; a chronologer of theirs saysF17R. Gedaliah, Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 2. 2.  it was in the hundred and third year of Abraham, that is, when Isaac was three years old, which agrees with the Apocrypha:&quot;But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.' (2 Maccabees 7:27 )According to JeromF18Quaestion. in Genesin, fol. 68. K. tom. 3. , it was the opinion of some of the Hebrews that he was five years old; and at this age Bishop UsherF19Annal. Vet Test. p. 9.  places the weaning of him; for to make him ten or twelve years of age, as some of the Rabbins doF20Pirke Eliezer, c. 30. Vid. Hieron. Quaest. ut supra. (in Genesin, fol. 68. K. tom. 3.) , when this was done, is very unlikely. Philo the JewF21De his Verb. Resipuit. Noe, p. 275.  makes him to be seven years of age at this time: </p>
<p> and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned ; because he had now escaped the dangers of infancy, and had gone through or got over those disorders infants are exposed unto, and had his health confirmed, and there was great likelihood of his living and becoming a man, since now he could eat and digest more solid and substantial food; and this was great joy to Abraham, which he expressed by making a grand and sumptuous entertainment for his family, and for his neighbours, whom he might invite upon this occasion. Jarchi says, the great men of that age were at it, even Heber and Abimelech. The Jews very impertinently produce this passage, to show the obligation they lie under to make a feast at the circumcision of their infantsF23Pirke Eliezer, c. 29. fol. 30. 1. ; for this was not at Isaac's circumcision, but at his weaning. </p>

<p>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian ,.... That is, Ishmael, who is not expressed by name, but described by being a son of Hagar, a servant of Sarah's, and an Egyptian woman; all which seems to be observed by way of slight, both to Hagar and her son: </p>
<p> which she had born unto Abraham ; not unto Sarah, as she proposed to herself, when she gave her maid to Abraham, Genesis 16:2 . This son of Abraham she saw </p>
<p> mocking ; either at the entertainment made at the weaning of Isaac; or rather at Isaac himself, laughing at his name, and treating him with contempt as his younger brother, and boasting that he was the firstborn, and that the inheritance belonged to him; and threatening what he would do to him, should he hereafter offer to dispute it with him, under pretence of the promise of God that he should be Abraham's heir, and at which promise also he may be supposed to mock: and that this contention was about the inheritance seems plain from the words of Sarah in Genesis 21:10 ; and in it Ishmael might not only rise to high words, but come to blows, and beat his brother; for it is observed the word used sometimes so signifies, 2 Samuel 2:14 ; wherefore the apostle might truly call it a persecution, Galatians 4:29 ; and as even cruel mockings are, Hebrews 11:35 . As for the various senses the Jewish commentators put upon this, there does not seem to be any foundation for them, as that Ishmael was committing idolatry, and endeavouring to draw his brother into it; or was talking in an indecent and lascivious manner, in order to corrupt his mind; or that he was intending and attempting to take away his life, by shooting an arrow at him, and pretending it was but in jest and in play; See Gill on Galatians 4:29 . </p>

<p>Wherefore she said unto Abraham, cast out this bondwoman and her son ,.... Hagar, Sarah's handmaid and bondservant, and her son Ishmael; by this it appears that Hagar was concerned in this affair, and set her son on to mock Isaac, at least she encouraged him in it, buoying: him up with his being the firstborn, and having a right to the inheritance; wherefore Sarah saw plainly that there would be no peace nor comfort for her and her son, unless Hagar and her son were turned out of doors, for which she moves Abraham; and this not merely in a passion, but by divine direction and influence, as is evident from God's approbation of it: </p>
<p> for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac ; which he would seem to be, if continued, and would think himself so, and there would be continual bickerings about it; wherefore, to put it out of all doubt who was heir, she desires that he and his mother both might be cast out of the house, which would be a clear determination of this matter. Sarah may seem to take upon her too much, to be so peremptory, as to declare who should, and who should not be heir, which more properly belonged to Abraham, whom she called her lord, Genesis 18:12 ; but what will sufficiently free her from any charge of this kind is the revelation of the divine will, and the promise of God that so it should be; namely, that the covenant God had so often renewed with Abraham should be established with Isaac, and not with Ishmael, Genesis 17:19 . Now what was the design of God, in guiding Sarah to make such a motion as this to Abraham, is taught us by the Apostle Paul, who makes these two women to be types and figures of the two covenants, and their sons of those that are under them, see Galatians 4:22 . </p>

<p> because of his son ; his son Ishmael; not grieved and uneasy for what he had done; not for committing idolatry, as the Targum of Jonathan suggests, or for mocking at Isaac; but for what was proposed to be done to him, the ejection of him from his house, because of the great love he had for him, and the great concern he had for his education, and that he might enjoy the blessing promised him, he, was loath to have him cast out of his family: no concern is expressed for Hagar, though both by what God said to Abraham, and by the provision he made for her, he had a regard unto her; but his chief concern was for his son, who perhaps had a greater share in his natural affections than as yet Isaac had; nor did express so much reluctance when he was bid to him up, as he did at this time, that being at the command of God, this at the instance of his wife, and which he supposed only proceeded from passion and resentment: the Hebrew writers sayF24Pirke Eliezer, c. 30. , that of all the evils that came upon Abraham this was the hardest and most grievous in his sight. </p>

<p>And God said unto Abraham ,.... Either by an articulate voice, or by an impulse on his mind, suggesting to him what he should do, being no doubt in great perplexity how to conduct between his wife and his son, but God determines the case for him, and makes him easy: </p>
<p> let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of the bondwoman : that is, let not the motion displease thee, which Sarah has made, to turn out the bondwoman and her son; let not thine affection to the one and to the other hinder compliance with it; do not look upon it as an ill thing, or as an hard thing; it is but what is right and proper to be done, and leave the bondwoman and her son to me; I will take care of them, be under no concern for them and their welfare: </p>
<p> in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken to her voice ; the Targum of Jonathan adds, for she is a prophetess: and indeed in this affair she spoke under a spirit of prophecy, according to the will of God; at least what she said became a divine oracle, and is called the Scripture, Galatians 4:30 ; for the word &quot;all&quot; here must be restrained to what she had said concerning Hagar and Ishmael, and their ejection, and not to be extended to everything she had said, or should say to Abraham, to which he was always to be attentive: whereas on the other hand, it became her, as a wife, to hearken and be obedient to the voice of her husband: but in this particular Abraham is bid to listen to her, and do accordingly, for the following reason: </p>
<p> for in Isaac shall thy seed be called ; he, and those that descended from him, should be called and reckoned the seed of Abraham more especially; and Abraham's seed in his life should inherit the land of Canaan, given to him and his seed for an inheritance: and this is a good reason why the bondwoman and her son should be cast out, that they or their offspring might not inherit the land with Isaac, or his descendants; and particularly from Abraham in his line, and not in the line of Ishmael, should the Messiah spring, that seed in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed; and therefore a separation was necessary, that this might abundantly appear. </p>

<p>And Abraham rose up early in the morning ,.... It was in the night the Lord spoke to him, and bid him hearken to the voice of Sarah; and, as soon as it was morning, he arose, and was not disobedient to the heavenly vision; for, though the thing he was directed to was disagreeable to flesh and blood, and contrary to his natural affection, yet, it being the will of God, he readily complied with it: </p>
<p> and took bread and a bottle of water ; a loaf of bread very probably, and a leathern or wooden bottle of water, as Aben Ezra supposes it to be; for there is no need to say that these are put for all necessaries, and a liberal provision that might be made by Abraham; but it is to be taken strictly, according to the letter and history, as a matter of fact, since it could be no more than Hagar could carry, and did carry upon her shoulder: and, though Abraham could have sent cattle laden with provisions, and servants to attend them, yet he did not, which his natural affection and liberal disposition might dictate to him; but, as he was to hearken in this affair to whatsoever Sarah said, and act accordingly, perhaps this was all she would grant; or it might be so ordered by the providence of God, as a chastisement for their ill behaviour, and that they might know the difference between being in Abraham's house and out of it; and that there might be an opportunity given to show favour to them for Abraham's sake, who might probably direct them to some place where to go; and, till they came there, this might be a sufficient supply, when he gave them reason to expect more from him; but they got into the wilderness, wandered about and lost their way, and so became destitute of provisions; and this may be an emblem of the low, mean, and starving condition such are in who are under the law, and seek for happiness by the works of it: </p>
<p> and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder ; that is, the bread and the water, which might be put in one parcel or bundle, or in a basket, and so laid and carried on her shoulder: the Targum of Jonathan adds,&quot;and bound it to her loins, to show that she was an handmaid:&quot; </p>
<p> and the child ; not that the child was &quot;on her shoulder&quot;, which is quite improbable; for, since he was thirteen years of age when he was circumcised, he must be fourteen when Isaac was born; and if Isaac was two years old when weaned, Ishmael must be sixteen; and if he was three years of age, he must be seventeen; and if five years, he must be nineteen: some of the Jewish writers sayF26Pirke Eliezer, c. 30. Bereshit Rabba, sect. 53. fol. 47. 4. , he was twenty seven years of age when he went out of his father's house; but they seem to come nearest the truth that make this event to be when he was at the age of seventeenF1Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 2. 2. , and when he must be too big to be carried on his mother's shoulder: but the sense is, that Abraham, when he put the provision on her shoulder, gave Ishmael to her, delivered him into her hand, to be taken care of by her; and very probably she led him in her hand: </p>
<p> and sent her away  out of his house to some place assigned for her; the Targum of Jonathan adds, with a bill of divorce, dismissing her not only from his house, but as his wife; and so the Jewish writersF2 generally understand it: but there is no reason to believe there was any such custom before the law of Moses: nay, they go further, and say, that he dismissed her from himself, and from Isaac his son, and from this world, and from the world to come: </p>
<p> and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba ; or, as the Targum of Jonathan, in the wilderness which was near to Beersheba; the place where it is probable Abraham now lived, and where Isaac was born, and the above affair was transacted, which was afterwards called by this name; for this is said by way of anticipation, see Genesis 21:31 .

<p>And it came to pass at that time ,.... Not when Ishmael was grown up and married, but when Isaac was weaned and Ishmael was expelled: </p>
<p> that Abimelech, and Phichol, the chief captain of his host, spake unto Abraham ; Abimelech was king of Gerar, the same that is spoken of in the preceding chapter, and Phichol was the general of his army; these two great personages came together and paid Abraham a visit, and had some conversation with him, who was still in Gerar, or however in some part of that country not far from it: </p>
<p> saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest ; greatly prospered him in the things of the world, for of them only could they make a judgment; they saw that he increased in worldly substance, and that his family was increased, and that he succeeded in everything in which he engaged; and, being jealous of his growing greatness and power, were desirous of securing an interest in him and in his favour. </p>

<p>Now therefore swear unto me here by God ,.... By the true and living God, by whom only an oath is to be taken, who was Abraham's God, and whom Abimelech seems to have known and to have been a worshipper of; and therefore moves for an oath to be taken by him, which he knew would be sacred and binding to Abraham, could he prevail upon him to swear: </p>
<p> that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son ; perhaps he had heard that God had promised to give the whole land of Canaan to him and his posterity, and among the rest his kingdom, which was a part of it; and, seeing him grow great and powerful, he could not tell how soon it might be ere he was put in the possession of it, whether in his own time, or his son's, or his grandson's; and therefore desires Abraham that he would swear to do no hurt to them whenever it should be: </p>
<p> but according to the kindness I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned ; that, as he had given him full liberty to sojourn in any part of his kingdom where he pleased, so, when the whole country should come into his possession, that he, or his son, or his grandson, in whatsoever time it should be, might quietly enjoy their own land, and all the inhabitants of it; at least that they might not be driven out of it, but sojourn in it as he had done. </p>

<p> which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away : that is, had by force taken the use of it to themselves for their cattle, and had deprived Abraham of it, though it was of his own digging; and perhaps there might be more than one, and the singular may be put for the plural; and so the Septuagint version has it, &quot;the wells&quot;: see Genesis 26:15 . </p>

Sotah, fol. 10. 1.  are divided about the use of this grove, as Jarchi relates; one says it was for a paradise or orchard, to produce fruits out of it for travellers and for entertainment; another says it was for an inn to entertain strangers in; it rather was for a shade, to shelter from the sun in those sultry and hot countries; and perhaps for a religious use, and to be an oratory, as the following words seem to suggest: in the midst of it very likely Abraham built an altar, and sacrificed to the Lord; hence might come the superstitious use of groves among the Heathens; and, when they came to be abused to idolatrous purposes, they were forbidden by the law of Moses, which before were lawful. And, though the name of Abraham is not in the text, there is no doubt but he is designed, and was the planter of the grove, and which is expressed in the Septuagint version, as it is supplied by us.

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 22  </p>
<p> In this chapter we have an account of an order given by God to Abraham to sacrifice his son, Genesis 22:1 ; of his readiness to obey the will of God, he immediately preparing everything for that purpose, Genesis 22:3 , of the order being reversed, and another sacrifice substituted in its room, which occasioned the giving a new name to the place where it was done, Genesis 22:11 ; upon which the promise of special blessings, of a numerous offspring, and of the seed in whom all nations should be blessed, is renewed, Genesis 22:15 ; after this Abraham returns to Beersheba, where he is informed of the increase of his brother Nahor's family, Genesis 22:19 . </p>

<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 22:1" display="now" /><b>Gen 22:1</b></p>


<p>And it came to pass after these things ,.... Recorded in the preceding chapter: according to the TalmudistsF2T. Bab. Sanhedrin: fol. 89. 2. , the following affair was transacted quickly after the weaning of Isaac, when he was about five years old, which is the opinion of some, as Aben Ezra on Genesis 22:4 ; makes mention of; but that is an age when it can hardly be thought he should be able to carry such a load of wood as was sufficient to make a fire to consume a burnt offering, Genesis 22:6 ; the age of thirteen, which he fixes upon, is more likely: JosephusF3Antiqu. l. 1. c. 13. sect. 2.  says, that Isaac was twenty five years of age; and in this year of his age Bishop UsherF4Annales Vet. Test. p. 10.  places this transaction, twenty years after the weaning of him, in A. M. 2133, and before Christ 1871; and near to this is the computation of a Jewish chronologerF5Ganz Tzemach David, par. 1. fol. 6. 1. , who makes Isaac to be at this time twenty six years of age; but some make him much older: according to the Targum of Jonathan, he was at this time thirty six years old; and it is the more generally received opinion of the Jewish writersF6Zohar in Gen. fol. 68. 2. & 74. 4. & 76. 2. Targ. Hieros. in Exod. xii. 42. Praefat. Echa Rabbat. fol. 40. 2. Pirke Eliezer, c. 31. Seder Olam Rabba, c. 1. p. 3. Juchasin, fol. 9. 1. Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 3. 1.  that he was and with whom the Arabic writersF7Patricides, p. 19. Elmacinus, p. 34. Apud Hottinger. Smegma, p. 327, &c.  agree: so that this affair, after related, was thirty years after the weaning of Isaac and the expulsion of Ishmael, supposing Isaac to be then five years old. But, however this be, what came to pass was after many promises of a son had been given him, and those fulfilled; and after many blessings had been bestowed upon him; and when he seemed to be well settled in the land of the Philistines, having entered into an alliance with the king of the country; his family in peace, and his son Isaac, the son of the promise, grown up and a hopeful youth; the first appearance of which seemed to threaten the destruction of all his comforts, hopes, and expectations; and it was so: </p>
<p> that God did tempt Abraham ; not to sin, as Satan does, for God tempts no man, nor can he be tempted in this sense; and, had Abraham slain his son, it would have been no sin in him, it being by the order of God, who is the Lord of life, and the sovereign disposer of it; but he tempted him, that is, he tried him, to prove him, and to know his faith in him, his fear of him, his love to him, and cheerful obedience to his commands; not in order to know these himself, which he was not ignorant of, but to make them known to others, and that Abraham's faith might be strengthened yet more and more, as in the issue it was. The Jewish writersF8Targum. Hieros. in loc. Pirke Eliezer, c. 31.  observe, that Abraham was tempted ten times, and that this was the tenth and last temptation: </p>
<p> and said unto him, Abraham : calling him by his name he well knew, and by that name he had given him, to signify that he should be the father of many nations, Genesis 17:5 ; and yet was going to require of him to slay his only son, and offer him a sacrifice to him: </p>
<p> and he said, behold, here I am ; signifying that he heard his voice, and was ready to obey his commands, be they what they would. </p>

<p>And he said, take now thy son ,.... Directly, immediately; not thine ox, nor thy sheep, nor thy ram, nor thy lamb, nor thy servant, but thy son: </p>
<p> thine only son Isaac ; for, though Ishmael was his son, he was a son by his maid, by his concubine, and not by his wife; Isaac was his only legitimate son, his only son by his lawful wife Sarah; the only son of the promise, his only son, in whom his seed was to be called: </p>
<p> whom thou lovest ; on whom his affections were strongly set, being a lovely youth, a dutiful son, and the child of promise; on whom all his hope and expectation of a numerous offspring promised him was built, and in whose line the Messiah was to spring from him; even Isaac, which stands last in the original text: so that, if what had been said was not sufficient to describe him, he is expressed by name, and the description is gradually given, and the name of his son reserved to the last, that he might be by degrees prepared to receive the shocking order; every word is emphatic and striking, and enough to pierce any tender heart, and especially when told what was to be done to him. The JewsF9T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 89. 2. Pirke Eliezer, c. 31. Jarchi in loc.  represent God and Abraham in a discourse together upon this head: God said, take now thy son; says Abraham, I have two sons; take thine only son; says he, they are both only sons to their mothers; take him whom thou lovest; I love them both, replied he; then take Isaac; thus ended the debate: </p>
<p> and get thee into the land of Moriah ; so called by anticipation, from a mountain of that name in it; the Septuagint render it, &quot;the high land&quot;, the hill country of the land of Canaan, particularly that part of it where Jerusalem afterwards stood, which was surrounded with hills: hence Aquila, another Greek interpreter, renders it, &quot;conspicuous&quot;, as hills and mountains are, and a mountainous country is; Onkelos and Jonathan paraphrase it, &quot;a land of worship&quot;, of religious worship; for in this country afterwards the people of God dwelt, the city of the living God was built, and in it the temple for divine service, and that upon Mount Moriah; and the Targum of Jerusalem has it here,&quot;to Mount Moriah;'the Jews are divided about the reason of this name, some deriving it from a wordF11&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;   &quot;docuit&quot;.  which signifies to &quot;teach&quot;, and think it is so called, because doctrine or instruction came forth from thence to Israel; others from a wordF12&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;   &quot;timuit&quot;.  which signifies &quot;fear&quot;, and so had its name because fear or terror went from thence to the nations of the worldF13T. Bab. Taanith, fol. 16. 1. ; but its derivation is from another wordF14&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;   &quot;vidit&quot;. , which signifies to &quot;see&quot;, and which is confirmed by what is said Genesis 22:14 , </p>
<p> and offer him there for a burnt offering ; this was dreadful work he was called to, and must be exceeding trying to him as a man, and much more as a parent, and a professor of the true religion, to commit such an action; for by this order he was to cut the throat of his son, then to rip him up, and cut up his quarters, and then to lay every piece in order upon the wood, and then burn all to ashes; and this he was to do as a religious action, with deliberation, seriousness, and devotion: </p>
<p> upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of ; for there were several of them adjoining to, or pretty near each other, which afterwards went by different names, as Mount Sion, Deuteronomy 4:48 ; the hill Acra; Mount Calvary, Luke 23:33 ; and Mount Moriah, 2 Chronicles 3:1 ; supposed to be the mount intended; and so Aben Ezra says it was the place where the temple was built, and where was the threshing floor of Araunah, 2 Chronicles 3:1 . Some learned men are of opinion, that the account which SanchoniathoF15Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praeparat. p. 38.  gives of Cronus or Saturn sacrificing his own son, refers to this affair of Abraham's; his words are,&quot;there being a pestilence and a mortality, Cronus offered up his only son a whole burnt offering to his father Ouranus;'which PorphyryF16Apud ib. p. 40. & l. 4. c. 15. p. 156. , from the same historian, thus relates; Cronus, whom the Phoenicians call Israel, (a grandson of Abraham's, thought, through mistake, to be put for Abraham himself,) having an only son of a nymph of that country called Anobret, (which according to BochartF17Canaan, l. 2. c. 2. col. 711, 712.  signifies one that conceived by grace, see Hebrews 11:11 ;) whom therefore they called Jeoud (the same with Jehid here, an only once); so an only one is called by the Phoenicians; when the country was in great danger through war, this son, dressed in a royal habit, he offered up on an altar he had prepared. But othersF18See Cumberland's Sanchoniatho, p. 37, 38, 134, &c.  are of a different sentiment, and cannot perceive any likeness between the two cases: however, Isaac may well be thought, in the whole of this, to be a type of the Messiah, the true and proper Son of God, his only begotten Son, the dear Son of his love, in whom all the promises are yea and amen; whom God out of his great love to men gave to be an offering and a sacrifice for their sins, and who suffered near Jerusalem, on Mount Calvary, which very probably was a part of Mount Moriah; and which, with other mountains joining in their root, though having different tops, went by that common name. </p>

<p>And Abraham rose up early in the morning ,.... For it seems it was in a dream or vision of the night that the above orders were given; and as soon as it was morning he rose and prepared to execute them with all readiness, and without any hesitation and delay: </p>
<p> and saddled his ass ; for his journey, not to carry the wood and provision on, which probably were carried by his servants, but to ride on; and this Jarchi thinks he did himself, and the words in their precise sense suggest this; but it does no, necessarily follow, because he may be said to do what he ordered his servant to do; of the Jews' fabulous account of this ass, see Zechariah 9:9 , </p>
<p> and took two of his young men with him ; the Targum of Jonathan says, these were Ishmael his son, and Eliezer his servant; and so other Jewish writersF18Pirke Eliezer, c. 31. Jarchi in loc. , who tell us, that just at this time Ishmael came out of the wilderness to visit his father, and he took him with him; but for this there is no foundation: they were two of his servants, of whom he had many: </p>
<p> and Isaac his son : who was the principal person to be taken, since he was to be the sacrifice: whether Abraham acquainted Sarah with the affairs and she consented to it, cannot be said with certainty; it is plain Isaac knew not what his father's design was; and though Sarah and the whole family might know, by the preparation made, he was going to offer a sacrifice, yet they knew not where, nor what it was to be: </p>
<p> and clave the wood for the burnt offering ; not knowing whether he should find wood sufficient on the mountain, where he was to go; and that he might not be unprovided when he came there, takes this method, which shows his full intention to obey the divine command: </p>
<p> and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him ; that is, he mounted his ass, and rode towards the place God had spoken of to him, and who had directed him which way to steer his course. </p>

<p>Then on the third day ,.... After he had received the command from God, and from his setting out on his journey; for he had now travelled two days, Mount Moriah being forty miles from Beersheba, where Abraham dweltF19Bunting's Travels, p. 57. ; or, as others compute it, forty: HebronF20Reland. Palestina illustrata, tom. 2. p. 620.  was twenty miles from Beersheba, and Jerusalem twenty two from Hebron; and to travel twenty miles a day on foot, as Isaac and the servants seem to have done, there being but one ass among them, was far enough in those hot countries. Now all this while Abraham had time to reconsider things in his mind, and deliberate thoroughly what he was going about; and by proceeding in it, after he had such leisure to revolve things in his mind, it appears that he was satisfied it was not an illusion, but an oracle of God he was going to obey; and that he did not do this rashly and hastily, and that his faith and obedience were sufficiently tried, and found genuine. The JewsF21Bereshit Rabba, sect. 56. fol. 49. 3.  take great notice of this third day, and compare the passage with Hosea 6:2 ; and which they interpret of the third day of the resurrection; and the deliverance of Isaac on this third day was doubtless typical of Christ's resurrection from the dead on the third day; for from the time that Abraham had the command to offer up his son, he was reckoned no other by him than as one dead, from whence he received him in a figure on this third day, Hebrews 11:19 , </p>
<p> Abraham lift up his eyes, and saw the place afar off ; where he was to offer his Son. Baal Hatturim says, the word &quot;place&quot;, by gematry, signifies Jerusalem: it seems by this, that as God had signified to Abraham that he would tell him of the place, and show it to him, where he was to sacrifice, so that he gave him a signal by which he might know it, which some of the Jewish writersF23Bereshit Rabba, sect. 56. fol. 49. 3. Jarchi in loc.  say was a cloud upon the mount; with which agrees the Targum of Jonathan,&quot;and Abraham lift up his eyes and saw the cloud of glory smoking upon the mountain, and he knew it afar off.'And others sayF24Pirke Eliezer, ut supra. (c. 31.) , he saw the glory of the divine Majesty standing upon the mount, in a pillar of fire, reaching from earth to heaven; and they further observe, that the place where he was, when he saw this, was Zophim, a place not far from Jerusalem; and from hence, when the city and temple were built, a full view might be taken of themF25Gloss. in T.

<p>And Abraham said unto the young men, abide you here with the ass ,.... At the place from whence he had his first sight of Mount Moriah: he chose not to take his two servants with him, lest when they saw him binding his son, and going about to sacrifice him, they should lay hold upon him, and restrain him from doing it; and to prevent this he takes this precaution, which shows how fully intent he was to yield obedience to the divine precept: </p>
<p> and I and the lad will go yonder and worship ; pointing to the place where the signal was, but whether they saw it or no is not certain: the Jews sayF26Bereshit Rabba (sect. 56. fol. 49. 2, 3.) and Pirke Eliezer, ut supra. (c. 31.)  Isaac did see it, but they did not; however, Abraham made them to understand that he was going to one of the mountains which were in sight, and there worship God by offering sacrifice to him. Isaac is here called a &quot;lad&quot;; of what age he was at this time; see Gill on Genesis 22:2 ; and he might be at the largest number of years there mentioned, and yet be so called, since Joshua the son of Nun has this appellation when he was fifty six years of age, Exodus 33:11 , </p>
<p> and come again to you , both he and Isaac; this he said under a spirit of prophecy, as Jarchi thinks, or in the faith of Isaac's resurrection from the dead, Hebrews 11:19 . </p>

<p>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering ,.... Which JosephusF1Antiqu. l. 1. c. 13. sect. 2.  says was laid upon the ass, and carried by that; and if so, he took it from thence: but it is probable it was carried by his two servants, since it was not more than Isaac himself afterwards carried, as in the next clause: </p>
<p> and laid it upon Isaac his son : who was a grown man, and able to carry it: in this also he was a type of Christ, on whom the wood of his cross was laid, and which he bore when he went to be crucified, John 19:17 ; and this wood may be also a figure of our sins laid on him by his Father, and which he bore in his body on the tree, 1 Peter 2:24 ; and which were like wood to fire, fuel for the wrath of God, which came down upon him for them: </p>
<p> and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife ; a vessel in one hand, in which fire was to kindle the wood with, and a knife in the other hand to slay the sacrifice with; the one to slay his son with, and the other to burn him with; and to carry these for such purposes must be very trying. This is the first time we read in Scripture of fire for use, or of a knife. Some say the first inventor of fire was Prometheus, others PhoroneusF2Pausan. Corinthiaca sive, l. 2. p. 119. , from whence he seems to have his name; but according to SanchoniathoF3Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 1. c. 10. p. 34. , the immediate posterity of Cain first invented it, whose names were light, fire, and flame; and these, he says, found out the way of generating fire, by rubbing pieces of wood against each other, and taught men the use of it. &quot;Knife&quot;, in the Hebrew language, has its name from eating and consuming, as Ben Melech observes; some render it a &quot;sword&quot;F4&#1492;&#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;   &quot;gladium&quot;, V.

<p> and he said, here am I, my son ; what hast thou to say to me? I am ready to answer thee; he owns the relation he stood in unto him, a sense of which he had not put off, and curbs his affections, which must be inwardly moving towards him, and showed great strength of faith to grapple with such a trying exercise: </p>
<p> and he said, behold the fire and the wood ; the fire which his father had his hand, and the wood which was upon his own, shoulders: </p>
<p> but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ? he perceived by the preparation made, by the fire and the wood, that it was to be a burnt offering which they were going to offer; but there being no creature provided for the sacrifice, he puts this question, by which it appears that as yet he was quite ignorant of the true design of this journey, and little thought that he was to be the sacrifice: however, from what he said, it plain he had been used to sacrifices, and had been trained up in them, and had seen them performed, and knew the nature of them, and what were requisite unto them. </p>

<p>And Abraham said, my son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering ,.... In which answer Abraham may have respect to the Messiah, the Lamb of God, John 1:29 , whom he had provided in council and covenant before the world was; and who in promise, and type, and figure, was slain from the foundation of the world, Revelation 13:8 ; and whom in due time God would send into the world, John 10:36 , and make him an offering for sin, Isaiah 53:10 , and accept of him in the room and stead of his people: and this was a provision that could only be made by the Lord, and was the produce of his infinite wisdom, and the fruit of his grace, favour, and good will and of which Abraham had a clear sight and strong persuasion, see John 8:56 ; though as the words may be considered as a more direct answer to Isaac's question, which related to the sacrifice now about to be offered, they may be regarded as a prophecy of Abraham's, and of his faith in it, that God would, as in fact he did, provide a lamb or ram in the room of that he was called to offer; or he may mean Isaac himself, whom he was bid to take and offer, and so was a lamb of God's providing; though he did not choose directly to say this, but puts him off with such an answer, suggesting that it was best for him to leave it with God, who, as he had called them to such service, would supply them with a proper sacrifice; and in speaking in this manner he might give room for Isaac to suspect what was intended, and so by degrees bring him to the knowledge of it. Some Jewish writersF5Pirke Eliezer, ut supra. (c. 31.)  say, that Abraham to this answer added in express terms,&quot;my son, thou art the lamb:&quot; </p>
<p> so they went both of them together ; they proceeded on in their journey until they came to the place they were directed to go. The Targum of Jonathan says,&quot;they went both of them with a perfect heart as one;'the Jerusalem Targum is,&quot;with a quiet, easy, and composed mind or heart;'and Jarchi,&quot;with a like heart;'all intimating that Isaac was thoroughly acquainted with what was to be done, that he was to be the sacrifice, and that he heartily agreed to it, and that he and his father were of one mind in it, and that he went with the same will to be offered up, as his father did to offer him; and indeed the expression being repeated from Genesis 22:6 , seems to suggest something remarkable and worthy of attention. </p>

<p>And they came to the place which God had told him of ,.... Mount Moriah. MaimonidesF6Hilchot Beth Habechirah, c. 2. sect. 1. 2.  says,&quot;it is a tradition in or by the hands of all, that this is the place where David and Solomon built an altar in the threshing floor of Araunah, the Jebusite, and where Abraham built an altar, and bound Isaac on it; and where Noah built one when he came out of the ark, and is the altar on which Cain and Abel offered; and where the first man offered when he was created, and from whence he was created.'And so the Targum of Jonathan, and other Jewish writersF7In Pirke, ut supra. (c. 31.) . The Mahometans sayF8See Pitts's Account of the Mahometans, c. 7. p. 97. , that Meena or Muna, a place about two or three miles from Mecca, is the place where Abraham went to offer up his son Isaac, and therefore in this place they sacrifice their sheep. </p>
<p> And Abraham built an altar there ; of the earth, and turf upon it he found on the mount, erected an altar for sacrifice, even for the sacrifice of his own son: he had built many before, but none for such a purpose as this, and yet went about it readily, and finished it. But if there was one before, Abraham could not with any propriety be said to build it, at most only to repair it; but there is no doubt to be made of it that he built it anew, and perhaps there never was an altar here before: </p>
<p> and laid on the wood in order : for the sacrifice to be put upon it: </p>
<p> and bound Isaac his son : with his hands and feet behind him, as Jarchi says; not lest he should flee from him, and make his escape, as Aben Ezra suggests, but as it was the usual manner to bind sacrifices when offered; and especially this was so ordered, that Isaac might be a type of the Messiah, who was bound by the Jews, John 18:12 ; as well as he was bound and fastened to the cross: </p>
<p> and laid him on the altar upon the wood ; it is highly probable with his own consent; for if he was twenty five, and as some say thirty seven years of age, he was able to have resisted his father, and had he been reluctant could have cleared himself from the hands of his aged parent: but it is very likely, that previous to this Abraham opened the whole affair to him, urged the divine command, persuaded him to submit to it; and perhaps might suggest to him what he himself had faith in, that God would either revoke the precept, or prevent by some providence or another the fatal blow, or raise him again from the dead; however, that obedience to the will of God should be yielded, since disobedience might be attended with sad consequences to them both; and with such like things the mind of Isaac might be reconciled to this affair, and he willingly submitted to it; in which he also was a type of Christ, who acquiesced in the will of his Father, freely surrendered himself into the hands of justice, and meekly and willingly gave himself an offering for his people. </p>

<p> and took the knife to slay his son ; with a full intention to do it, which was carrying his obedience to the divine will to the last extremity, and shows he was sincere in it, and really designed to complete it; and this was taken by the Lord as if it was actually done. He had his knife in his hand, and was near the throat of his son, and just ready to give the fatal thrust; in another moment, as it were, it would have been all over; but in the nick of time God appeared and prevented it, as follows: </p>

<p> and said, Abraham, Abraham ; the repeating his name denotes haste to prevent the slaughter of his son, which was just upon the point of doing, and in which Abraham was not dilatory, but ready to make quick dispatch; and therefore with the greater eagerness and vehemency the angel calls him by name, and doubles it, to raise a quick and immediate attention to him, which it did: </p>

<p>And he said, lay not thine hand upon the lad ,.... Which he was just going to stretch out, with his knife in it, to slay him; and though the Lord had bid him take his son, and offer him for a burnt offering, to try his faith, fear, love, and obedience, yet he meant not that he should actually slay him, but would prevent it when it came to the crisis; for he approves not of, nor delights in human sacrifices; and that this might not be dawn into an example, it was prevented; though the Gentiles, under the influence of Satan, in imitation of this, have practised it: </p>
<p> neither do thou anything unto him ; by lacerating his flesh, letting out any of his blood, or wounding him ever so slightly in any part: </p>
<p> for now I know that thou fearest God ; with a truly childlike filial fear; with such a reverence of him that has fervent love, and strong affection, joined with it; with a fear that includes the whole of internal religious worship, awe of the divine Being, submission to his will, faith in him, and love to him, and obedience springing from thence. And this is said, not as though he was ignorant before how things would issue; for he knew from all eternity what Abraham would be, and what he would do, having determined to bestow that grace upon him, and work it in him, which would influence and enable him to act the part he did; he knew full well beforehand what would be the consequence of such a trial of him; but this is said after the manner of men, who know things with certainty when they come to pass, and appear plain and evident: or this may be understood of a knowledge of approbation, that the Lord now knew, and approved of the faith, fear, love, and obedience of Abraham, which were so conspicuous in this affair, see Psalm 1:6 ; Saadiah GaonF9Apud Aben Ezram, in ver. 1.  interprets it, &quot;I have made known&quot;, that is, to others; God by trying Abraham made it manifest to others, to all the world, to all that should hear of or read this account of things, that he was a man that feared God, loved him, believed in him, and obeyed him, of which this instance is a full and convincing proof: </p>
<p> seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me : but as soon as he had the order to offer him up, prepared for it, took a three days' journey, and all things along with him for the sacrifice; when he came to the place, built an altar, laid the wood in order, bound his son, and laid him on it, took the knife, and was going to put it to his throat; so that the Lord looked upon the thing as if it was really done: it was a plain case that he did not, and would not have withheld his son, but would have freely offered him a sacrifice unto God at his command; and that he loved the Lord more than he did his son, and had a greater regard to the command of God than to the life of his son, and preferred the one to the other. And thus God spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, Romans 8:32 . </p>

<p>And Abraham lifted up his eyes ,.... They were before fixed upon his son lying upon the altar, and intent upon that part he was going to thrust his knife into; but hearing a voice from heaven above him, he lift up his eyes thitherward: </p>
<p> and looked, and, behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns ; the ram making a noise and rustling among the bushes behind the place where Abraham was, he turned himself, and looked and saw it: the Targum of Onkelos introduces the clause thus, &quot;after these things&quot;; and so the Arabic version: after Abraham had heard the voice of the angel, and had lift up his eyes to heaven, he was directed to look behind him; and both that and the Targum of Jonathan paraphrase it,&quot;and he saw and beheld one ram;'and so the Septuagint, Syriac and Samaritan versions, reading &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;   instead of &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; . This ram was caught and held by his horns in a thicket of briers, brambles, and thorns, or in the thick branches of the shrubs or bushes which grew upon the mount; and the horns of a ram being crooked, are easily implicated in such thickets, but not easily loosed. From whence this ram came is not known; it can hardly be thought to come from Abraham's fold, or to be his property, since he was three days' journey distant from home; very likely it had strayed from neighbouring flocks, and was by the providence of God directed hither at a seasonable time. The Jewish writersF11Pirke Eliezer, ut supra. (c. 31.). Targum Jon. & Jarchi in loc.  say, it was from the creation of the world; and there is no absurdity or improbability to suppose it was immediately created by the power of God, and in an extraordinary manner provided; and was a type of our Lord Jesus, who was foreordained of God before the foundation of the world, and came into the world in an uncommon way, being born of a virgin, and that in the fulness of time, and seasonably, and in due time died for the sins of men. The ram has its name from &quot;strength&quot;, in the Hebrew language, and was an emblem of a great personage, Daniel 8:3 ; and may denote the strength and dignity of Christ as a divine Person; being caught in a thicket, may be an emblem of the decrees of God, in which he was appointed to be the Saviour; or the covenant agreement and transactions with his Father, in which he voluntarily involved himself, and by which he was held; or the sins of his people, which were laid upon him by imputation, were wreathed about him, and justice finding him implicated with them, required satisfaction, and had it; or the hands of wicked men, sons of Belial, comparable to thorns, by whom he was taken; or the sorrows of death and hell that encompassed him, and the curses of a righteous law which lay upon him; and perhaps he never more resembled this ram caught in a thicket, than when a platted crown of thorns was put upon his head, and he wore it: </p>
<p> and Abraham went and took the ram ; without regarding whose property it was, since God, the owner and proprietor of all, had provided it for him, and brought it to him at a very seasonable time, and directed him to take it: </p>
<p> and offered him for a burnt offering in the stead of his son ; in which also was a type of Christ, who was made an offering for sin, and a sacrifice to God of a sweet smelling savour; and its being a burnt offering denotes the sufferings of Christ, and the severity of them; and which were in the room and stead of his people, of God's Isaac, of spiritual seed of Abraham, of the children of God of the promise, of all his beloved ones; who therefore are let go, justice being satisfied with what Christ has done and suffered, it being all one as if they had suffered themselves; as here in the type, the ram having, its throat cut, its blood shed, its skin flayed, and the whole burnt to ashes, were as if Isaac himself had been thus dealt with, as Jarchi observes. Alexander PolyhistorF12Apud Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 9. c. 19. p. 421. , an Heathen writer, has, in agreement with the sacred history, given a narrative of this affair in a few words,&quot;God (he says) commanded Abraham to offer up his son Isaac to him for a burnt offering, and taking the lad with him to a mountain, laid and kindled an heap of wood, and put Isaac upon it; and when he was about to slay him, was forbidden by an angel, who presented a ram to him for sacrifice, and then Abraham removed his son from the pile, and offered up the ram.' </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 23  </p>
<p> This chapter treats of the age, death, and funeral of Sarah, and the place of her interment: of her age, Genesis 23:1 ; of her death, Genesis 23:2 ; of the motion Abraham made to the sons of Heth, to obtain a burial place among them, Genesis 23:3 ; of the answer of them to him, giving him leave to bury in any of their sepulchres, Genesis 23:5 ; of a second motion of his to them, to use their interest with Ephron the Hittite, to let him have the cave of Machpelah for the above purpose, Genesis 23:7 ; of Ephron's consent unto it, Genesis 23:10 ; of the purchase Abraham made of it for four hundred shekels of silver, Genesis 23:12 ; and of its being secured unto him, which he interred Sarah his wife, Genesis 23:17 . </p>

<p>And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old ,.... This following immediately upon the account of the offering up of Isaac, led many of the Jewish writers to conclude, that Isaac was when thirty seven years of age, as he must be when Sarah his mother was one hundred and twenty seven, for he was born when she was ninety years of age; but this seems not to be observed on that account, but to give the sum of her age at her death, since it follows: </p>
<p> these were the years of the life of Sarah ; who, as it is remarked by many interpreters, is the only woman the years of whose life are reckoned up in Scripture. </p>

<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 23:2" display="now" /><b>Gen 23:2</b></p>


<p>And Sarah died in Kirjatharba ,.... Which was so called, either, as Jarchi says, from the four Anakims or giants that dwelt here, Joshua 15:13 ; or else, as the same writer observes, from the four couple buried here, Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah; but then it must be so called by anticipation; rather, as Aben Ezra thinks, it had its name from Arba, a great man among the Anakims, and the father of Anak, Joshua 14:15 ; though some take it to be a Tetrapolls, a city consisting of four parts; but be it as it will, here Abraham and Sarah were at the time of her death; when they removed from Beersheba hither is not said: </p>
<p> the same is Hebron, in the land of Canaan ; so it was afterwards called: here Abraham and Sarah had lived many years ago, see Genesis 13:18 ; and hither they returned, and here they ended their days and were buried: </p>
<p> and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her ; Aben Ezra observes, that, when Sarah died, Abraham was in another place, and therefore is said to come to mourn for her; and the Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;and Abraham came from the mount of worship (Moriah), and found that she was dead, and he sat down to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.'OthersF21Pirke Eliezer, c. 32. Jarchi in loc.  report, that, upon hearing of the offering up of Isaac, she swooned away and died. But the meaning is, that he came from his own tent to Sarah's, see Genesis 24:67 , where her corpse was, to indulge his passion of grief and sorrow for her; which, in a moderate way, was lawful, and what natural affection and conjugal relation obliged him to. The HebrewsF23Baal Hatturim in loc.  observe, that, in the word for &quot;weep&quot;, one of the letters is lesser than usual, and which they think denotes, that his weeping for her was not excessive, but little; but both phrases put together seem to denote that his sorrow was very great; and the one perhaps may refer to his private, and the other to his public mourning for her, according to the custom of those times. </p>

<p>And Abraham stood up from before his dead ,.... The corpse of Sarah, by which he sat pensive and mourning, perhaps upon the ground, as was the custom of mourners, Job 1:13 ; where having sat awhile, he rose up and went out of the tent, to provide for the funeral of his wife as became him: </p>
<p> and spake unto the sons of Heth ; the descendants of Heth the son of Canaan, see Genesis 10:15 ; who were at this time the inhabitants and proprietors of that part of the land where Abraham now was: saying; as follows: </p>

<p>I am a stranger and a sojourner with you ,.... Not a native of the place, only dwelt as a sojourner among them for a time; but had not so much as a foot of ground he could call his own, and consequently had no place to inter his dead: </p>
<p> give me a possession of a buryingplace with you ; not that he desired it as a free gift, but that he might be allowed to make a purchase of a piece of ground to bury his dead in; so the Targum of Jonathan,&quot;sell me a possession,' &c. Genesis 23:9 ; and this he was the rather desirous of, not only because it was according to the rules of humanity, and the general custom of all nations, to provide for the burial of their dead; but he was willing to have such a place in the land of Canaan for this purpose, to strengthen his faith and the faith of his posterity, and to animate their hope and expectation of being one day put into the possession of it; hence the patriarchs in later times, as Jacob and Joseph, were desirous of having their hones laid there: </p>
<p> that I may bury my dead out of my sight ; for, though Sarah was a very lovely person in her life, and greatly desirable by Abraham, yet death had changed her countenance and was turning her into corruption, which rendered her unpleasant, and began to make her loathsome; so that there was a necessity of removing her out of his sight, who before had been so very agreeable to him; and this is the case of the dearest relation and friend at death. </p>

<p>Hear us, my lord ,.... One of them spake in the name of the rest, who calls Abraham not &quot;our lord&quot;, but &quot;my lord&quot;; addressing him very honourably, and desires he would hear what he had to say on the behalf of others with himself; &quot;hear us&quot;, representing not the body of the common people, but the princes among them, the heads of their families: </p>
<p> thou art a mighty prince amongst us ; though he was pleased to call himself a stranger and a sojourner, yet they had an high opinion of him, as a person of great wealth and substance, and of great power and authority; and who lived like a prince, and was a potent one, having a large train of servants under him: or, &quot;a prince of God&quot;F24&#1504;&#1513;&#1497;&#1488;  &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;   &quot;princeps Dei&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, Junius & Tremellius, Piscator, Vatablus, Drusius, Schmidt, &c. , as it may be rendered; one raised up to grandeur and dignity by him; with whom he was, find in whose sight he had favour, and was very grateful and acceptable; and by whom he was highly honoured, and had in great esteem as a friend of his: </p>
<p> in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead ; as they had many, every family a distinct sepulchre for itself, they made offer of them to him, to bury his dead in the choicest of them, the most grand and magnificent, or in which of them soever he pleased; which was very kind, generous, and respectful: </p>
<p> none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead ; there is not a man among us but what has such a regard for thee, that he will not deny thee the use of his sepulchre to bury thy dead in; and therefore need not scruple to make use of any that may be judged most proper and convenient: no doubt the speaker full well knew the mind of those in whose name he addressed Abraham. </p>

<p>And Abraham stood up ,.... For, having made his speech to the children of Heth, he sat down waiting for an answer; or rather perhaps they obliged him to sit down, out of reverence to so great a personage; and when they had done speaking, he rose up: </p>
<p> and bowed himself to the people of the land ; the principal of them, in token of the grateful sense he had of the honour they had done him, and of the great civility with which they had used him: </p>

<p> hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ; a principal man among the Hittites, who had a field and a cave in it, near where Abraham dwelt, and very convenient for him, and for this purpose of his now under consideration: this man seems to be present at this time, as appears from Genesis 23:10 ; but Abraham did not think fit to address him himself, lest he should not so well and so easily succeed; and therefore entreats the princes of Heth to unite in a request to Ephron for the favour after mentioned, which he supposed they would not be backward to, if they were hearty in this affair; and, if Ephron was present, as he seems to be, it was a very handsome, honourable, and modest address to him through his brethren, which he could not with any politeness well withstand.

<p>That he may, give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath ,  </p>
<p> which is in the end of his field ,.... The Targum of Jonathan renders it, &quot;the double cave&quot;, and so do the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions; and, according to Aben Ezra and Ben Melech, it was so called because there was a cave within a cave in it; and, as Jarchi thinks, because it was a house and chamber over itF25So in T. Bab. Erubin, fol. 53. 1.  or, as he adds, because it was fit for couples, for two corpses to be laid in it; and the Jews sayF26Pirke Eliezer, c. 20. & 36. , here Adam and Eve were buried, which made Abraham so desirous of having it for a buryingplace: but it seems rather to be the proper name of a place, and indeed of a tract of land, in which the field and the cave in the corner of it lay, and which all belonged to Ephron; for both the field and the cave in it are distinguished from Machpelah, in which they were, and that from them, Genesis 23:17 ; and it is highly probable, that this cave was never made use of before for such a purpose as it was now sought for, since Abraham did not think fit to accept of the offer made him of any of their sepulchres; and chose rather that his dead should not lie with them, but in a separate place, though among them, they being Heathens and idolaters, and unacquainted with the resurrection of the dead, and would have no part in the first resurrection, which Abraham believed and hoped for: </p>
<p> for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you ; or, &quot;for full money&quot;F1&#1489;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507;  &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;   &quot;in vel pro argento pieno&quot;, Pagninus, Montanus, Schmidt. , that which is full weight, for money was paid by weight in those times, as appears from Genesis 23:16 ; or for the full price and value of it: for, as Abraham did not desire to have it as a free gift, so neither at an under price; he was very willing to give the full worth of it; he did not ask it with any covetous view, or to encroach upon them. </p>

<p> the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein I give it thee ; which was more than Abraham asked to purchase; he only desired to have the cave, which lay in one corner of the field, but Ephron proposes both to give him the cave, and the field also: </p>
<p> in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee ; both field and cave; three times he says, &quot;I give it thee&quot;, to show that he freely gave it, and that Abraham was welcome to it, and for the confirmation of the grant: </p>

<p>My lord, hearken unto me ,.... Since it is your mind to buy the field, and not receive it as a gift, then hear what I have to say as to the value of it: </p>
<p> the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver ; which, reckoning a shekel at two shillings and sixpence, comes to fifty pounds of our money: </p>
<p> what is that betwixt thee and me ? between two persons so rich, the sum was trifling and inconsiderable, whether the one paid it, and the other received it, or not; or between two such friends it was not worth speaking of, it was no matter whether it was paid or not: or else the sense is, between us both it is honestly worth so much; it is a good bargain, and must be owned to be so, what is it? the sum is so small, and it is so clearly the worth of it, that there needs no more to be said about it: </p>

This clearly shows that Machpelah is the proper name of a place or tract of ground, and not an appellative, or to be rendered the double cave, since a field could never be said to be in a cave: and yet some have been so stupid, as Vatablus observes, as to render the words,&quot;the field of Ephron, which was in the double cave,'whereas, on the contrary, the cave was in that field; and so the Vulgate version, to better sense, though not agreeably to the Hebrew text,&quot;the field of Ephron, in which was the double cave:&quot; </p>

Aben Ezra takes them to be the travellers that passed and repassed through the gates of the city: however, the design of the expression is to show in what a public manner this affair was transacted, and that the field was made as firm and as sure to Abraham as it could well be, no writings on such occasion being used so early. </p>

<p> Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah ,  </p>
<p> before Mamre ; and here he himself was buried, and also Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah, Genesis 25:9 . Benjamin of TudelaF8Itinerarium, p. 48, 49.  says, in his time (who lived in the latter end of the twelfth century), in the field of Machpelah was a city or town, and in it a large temple called Saint Abraham, where were shown the sepulchres of the six persons before mentioned, and inscriptions over each of them, showing whose they were; and that at the end of the field was the house of Abraham, and before the house a fountain, and no other was suffered to be built there in honour to Abraham: </p>

Who were witnesses of the transaction between Abraham and Ephron; and this was further made sure by Sarah's being buried in it, which was taking possession of it, for the use for which it was bought; and was a pledge and earnest of the future possession of the land of Canaan by the seed of Abraham: this was the first piece of ground in it possessed by Abraham and his seed; and it being called the possession of a buryingplace, shows that there is no contradiction between this and what Stephen says, Acts 7:5 ; he had a possession to bury in, but not to live upon; not any ground of his own to till and sow, or build upon. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 24  </p>
<p> This chapter shows Abraham's concern to get a suitable wife for his son Isaac, for which purpose he commits the affair into the hands of his eldest servant, and makes him swear that he will not take one from among the Canaanites, but out of his own country, and from among his own kindred, Genesis 24:1 ; which his servant agreed to, after having the nature of his charge, and of the oath, explained to him, Genesis 24:5 ; upon which he departed to Mesopotamia, and coming to the city of Nahor, and to a well near it, he prayed for success, and desired direction by a token, which was granted him, Genesis 24:10 ; and inquiring of the damsel, who answered to the token, whose daughter she was, and whether they had room for him and his in their house; and an agreeable answer being returned, he gave thanks to God that had directed him, and had so far made his journey prosperous, Genesis 24:23 ; the damsel acquainting her parents whom and what she met with at the well, a brother of her steps out, and invites the servant in, and makes him welcome, Genesis 24:28 ; but before he would eat anything, he tells his errand he was come upon, at the instance of his master; how, he had prayed for direction, and was heard, and for which he had given thanks, Genesis 24:34 ; and then treats with the relations of the damsel about her marriage to his master's son, to which they agreed, Genesis 24:49 ; and after having blessed God, and given his presents he brought with him to the damsel, and her family, and ate and drank with them, was for departing the next morning, Genesis 24:52 ; but the friends of the damsel being desirous of her stay with them some few days, and he urgent to be gone, the affair was referred to her, and she agreed to go with him directly, Genesis 24:55 ; upon which they dismissed her with their blessing, Genesis 24:59 ; who being met by Isaac in the way, was received and introduced into his mother's tent, and married by him, Genesis 24:61 . </p>

<p>And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age ,.... Being now one hundred and forty years of age, for as he was an hundred years old when Isaac was born, and Isaac was forty years of age when he married Rebekah, which was at this time, Abraham must be of the age mentioned, see Genesis 21:5 , </p>
<p> and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things ; with all kind of blessings, with temporal and spiritual blessings; the former seems chiefly designed here, because of what follows; God had blessed him, as Aben Ezra observes, with long life, and riches, and honour, and children, things desirable by men. </p>
<h2 pb_toc="index">24:2</h2>
<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 24:2" display="now" /><b>Gen 24:2</b></p>


<p>And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house ,.... To Eliezer his servant, according to the Targum of Jonathan, and as is generally thought; and who may well be called an old servant, and his oldest servant, since he must have lived with him fifty years and upwards; one may trace him near sixty years in Abraham's family, and it is highly probable he lived much longer; he was his servant when he had the vision between the pieces, Genesis 15:2 ; and then he was the steward of his house, and bid fair to be his heir; which was some time before Hagar was given to Abraham; and Ishmael his son by Hagar was fourteen years of age when Isaac was born, and he was now forty years old, which make fifty five years, or thereabout. Bishop Usher places the vision of the pieces in A. M. 2092, and the marriage of Isaac in 2148, some fifty six years from each other; and so long Eliezer, if he is the servant here meant, must have been in Abraham's family, and how much longer cannot with certainty be said: </p>
<p> that ruled over all that he had ; had the care and management of his house, and the affairs of it under him; this agrees with the character of Eliezer in Genesis 15:2 , </p>
<p> put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh : as a token of his subjection to him as a servant, and of his readiness, willingness, and fidelity to execute any commands he should lay upon him, and in order to take an oath, as appears by what follows; for it seems this rite was used in swearing, and is still used in India, as Aben Ezra affirms; and some say among the Ethiopians. The Jewish writers are pretty much of opinion that respect is had to the covenant of circumcision, by which Abraham made his servant to swear, which is not likely: rather respect is had to his seed, the promised Messiah, that should spring from his thigh, by whom the adjuration was made, as follows: though Dr. ClaytonF11Chronology of the Hebrew Bible, p. 130, 131.  thinks this is no other than an equivalent term for approaching in an humble servile manner, and means no more than &quot;come near me&quot;, and I will make thee swear; and that, as a respectable method of approach with the Egyptian, as HerodotusF12Euterpe sive, l. 2.  relates, was by bowing the body reciprocally when they met, and saluted one another, and by carrying their hands to each other's knee; so some such like ceremony as embracing the knee, and putting the hand under or round the thigh, might be used by servants when they approached their masters; but it should be observed, that this same rite or ceremony was required of Joseph, governor of Egypt, by his father Jacob; see Genesis 47:29 . </p>

<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 24:3" display="now" /><b>Gen 24:3</b></p>


<p>And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of earth ,.... The Maker and possessor of heaven and earth, by whom Abraham used to swear whenever he did, and by whom only men should swear, see Genesis 14:22 . The Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;I will make thee swear by the name of the Word of the Lord God,'which strengthens the sense given of the rite before observed: </p>
<p> that thou wilt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell ; these being not only idolaters, and very wicked people, degenerated yet more and more, but were the seed of the accursed Canaan; and who in process of time would be dispossessed of the land, and be destroyed. Now though Isaac was forty years of age, and one would think at an age sufficient to have chosen a wife for himself; but as Abraham knew that he had a great respect for this servant, and would be influenced by him in such a choice, and especially as this affair was now about to be committed to his care, and no doubt with the consent of Isaac, therefore he thus charges and adjures him. </p>

<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 24:4" display="now" /><b>Gen 24:4</b></p>


<p>But thou shalt go unto my country ,.... Not Canaan, which though his by promise, yet not in possession, but Mesopotamia, as appears from Genesis 24:10 ; which taken largely included the Chaldea, see Acts 7:2 , the country where Abraham was born, and from whence he came: </p>
<p> and to my kindred ; the family of Nahor his brother, which now dwelt at Haran in Mesopotamia, called the city of Nahor, Genesis 24:10 ; see Genesis 29:4 ; of the increase of whose family Abraham had heard a few years ago, Genesis 22:20 , </p>
<p> and take a wife to my son Isaac ; from among them, who though they were not clear of superstition and idolatry, yet they worshipped the true God with their &quot;idols&quot;; and a woman taken out of such a family, and removed at a distance from it, it might be reasonably concluded would be brought off of those things, and adhere to the pure and undefiled religion; and the rather this family was chosen, not only because related to Abraham, but because it had sprung from Shem, who was blessed of God, and whose God the Lord was; nearness of kin was no objection and hinderance to such a marriage, the laws relating to marriage not being given till the time of Moses. </p>
<h2 pb_toc="index">24:5</h2>
<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 24:5" display="now" /><b>Gen 24:5</b></p>


<p>And the servant said unto him ,.... Before he would take the oath, being cautious of it, and desirous of knowing how far it reached, and what it would or would not oblige him to, which was prudently done: </p>
<p> peradventure the woman will not be to follow me into this land ; supposing this should be the case, as it is not unlikely that the woman would object to coming along with him to the land of Canaan, and insist upon Isaac's coming into her country, and dwelling there, what must then be done? </p>
<p> must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ? that is, must I agree with the woman on these terms, and promise that Isaac shall come and dwell with her in Mesopotamia? Now there was good reason for the servant's putting this question, since he was neither ignorant of the call of Abraham out of that laud, no more to return to it, nor of the promise of the land of Canaan to him and his posterity: and as for bringing Isaac &quot;again&quot;, where he never had been in person, this may be accounted for by his being in the loins of Abraham when he was there, and came from thence, as Levi is said to be in his loins when he paid tithes to Melchizedek, and to pay them in him, Hebrews 7:9 ; and in like manner he might be said to be brought again, or return to Abraham's country, should he ever go there, as all the seed of Abraham are said in the fourth generation to come to Canaan again, though they had none of them been in person there before, Genesis 15:16 ; besides, as Drusius observes, to bring again, or return, signifies sometimes only to bring on, or to go to some certain place, see  1:10 ; however, the justness of the expression is confirmed by Abraham's answer in the next words. </p>
<h2 pb_toc="index">24:6</h2>
<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 24:6" display="now" /><b>Gen 24:6</b></p>


<p>And Abraham said unto him ,.... Not blaming him for putting such a question, nor charging him with impertinence, but plainly seeing the propriety of it: and in order to clear up this matter to him, gives the following instructions: </p>
<p> beware thou, that thou bring not my son thither again ; for the command to come out of the land of Chaldea, never to return more, and to come into the land of Canaan, and there abide, respected both Abraham and his posterity; and besides, it was dangerous for Isaac to go into a family, where, though there was some knowledge of the true God, yet there was much superstition and idolatry in it, as appears by various hints in the sequel of this history, lest he should be corrupted, and degenerate from the true religion. </p>
<h2 pb_toc="index">24:7</h2>
<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 24:7" display="now" /><b>Gen 24:7</b></p>


<p>The Lord God of heaven, which took from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred ,.... Jarchi distinguishes between his father's house, and the land of his kindred; the former he takes to be Haran, in which he seems to be right; for his father and his family came with him from Ur of the Chaldees to Haran, and there stayed, from whence Abraham was taken and separated from them; by the latter he understands Ur of the Chaldees, interpreting the phrase of the land in which he was born, as Onkelos and Jonathan, and the Septuagint version render it: but the same is meant as before, for Haran was the land of his kindred, where Terah his father died, and Nahor his brother and family lived; from whence he was taken and removed into the land of Canaan, by the call, direction, and providence of the Lord God, who made the heavens, and dwells therein: </p>
<p> which spake unto me, and that swore unto me ; made a promise to him, and confirmed it with an oath, Genesis 15:18 , </p>
<p> saying, unto thy seed will I give this land ; the land of Canaan; and therefore his son, in whom his seed was to be called, must not be removed from hence, and settled in another country: </p>
<p> he shall send his angel before thee ; Aben Ezra takes this to be a prayer or wish, &quot;may he send his angel before thee&quot;; for if it was a prophecy, he adds, why did he say &quot;if the woman will not be willing?&quot; but from Genesis 24:10 ; and from what follows, that the servant should take a wife to his son from thence, and the encouragement he had for his faith in it, and from what God bad done for him, and said unto him, it seems as if he was fully assured in his own mind of the event: this angel may be either understood of a created angel, such being frequently made use of in the affairs of Providence, directing and succeeding men, or of the uncreated Angel, the Son of God, since the servant attributes his direction and success wholly to the Lord. </p>

<p>And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee ,.... Or &quot;but&quot; ifF13&#1493;&#1488;&#1501;   &quot;sin autem&quot;, V. L. , which is said by Abraham, not as doubting she would be willing, of which he was satisfied, being persuaded that that God that had made him willing to leave his own country, and his father's house, would make her willing to do the like, and come and settle with his son in the land that God had given him; but this, and what follows, he said to make the mind of his servant easy, who had some doubt about it, or however was desirous of knowing how he must act should that be the case; and what it was he was to take an oath to do, and how far, and how far not, that would oblige him: </p>
<p> then thou shalt be clear from this my oath ; which he enjoined his servant to take; the sense is, when he had done all he could to get the consent of the damsel, and her friends, to go with him and marry his master's son; and after all she could not be prevailed upon to come with him, then he was free from his oath, having done all that that obliged him to, and he not attempting to take one from any other quarter: </p>
<p> only bring not my son thither again ; neither agree with the damsel and her parents, that he shall come to them, nor persuade him to comply with such terms. </p>

<p>And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master ,  </p>
<p> and departed ,.... Camels were much in use in the eastern countries; where, as PlinyF15Nat. Hist. l. 7. c. 18.  says, they were brought up among their herds of cattle, and their riches much consisted in them. Arabia abounded with them; Job had three thousand of them, Job 1:3 ; how many Abraham had is not said, only ten of them his servant took, being sufficient for his present purpose, and which he took with his master's leave, and by his order. These creatures are very strong and fit for carrying great burdens, even a thousand pound weight, as is affirmed; and for riding, especially such as have two humps on their backs, for some have but one; and for long journeys, being very swift, and will travel without water many days, and so very proper to take on such journeys in hot and desert countries; see Gill on Leviticus 11:4 , </p>
<p> for all the goods of his master were in his hand ; which agrees with what is before said, that he was the steward of his house, and ruled over all that he had; this in our version, and others, is put in a parenthesis, and given as a reason why the servant took, as it may seem of himself, so many camels as he did, and then set forward on his journey: though it may be rendered, &quot;and of all the goods of his master in his hand&quot;; that is, he took some of the choicest and most valuable things his master had, and carried them along with him as presents to the damsel and her friends; to which sense the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions interpret the words
