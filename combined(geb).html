<p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS 1  </p>
<p> This chapter contains an account of the creation of the universe, and all things in it; asserts the creation of the heaven and earth in general, and describes the state and condition of the earth in its first production, Genesis 1:1   and then proceeds to declare the work of each of the six days of creation, and to give an account of light, its separation from darkness and the names of both, the work of the first day, Genesis 1:3   of the firmament, its use and name, the work of the second day, Genesis 1:6   of the appearance of the earth, and the production of grass, herbs, and trees in the earth, the work of the third day, Genesis 1:9   of the sun, moon, and stars, their situation, and use, the work of the fourth day, Genesis 1:14   of the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea, the work of the fifth day, Genesis 1:19   of all kinds of cattle, and beasts, and creeping things, Genesis 1:24   and then of man, created male and female, after the image of God, having a grant of dominion over the rest of the creatures, the fruit of divine consultation, Genesis 1:26   and of a provision of food for man and beast, Genesis 1:29 . And the chapter is concluded with a survey God took of all his works, and his approbation of them; all which were the work of the sixth day, and closes the account of the creation in that space of time, Genesis 1:31 . </p>

<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 1:1" display="now" /><b>Gen 1:1</b></p>


<p>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  By the heaven some understand the supreme heaven, the heaven of heavens, the habitation of God, and of the holy angels; and this being made perfect at once, no mention is after made of it, as of the earth; and it is supposed that the angels were at this time created, since they were present at the laying of the foundation of the earth, Job 38:6   but rather the lower and visible heavens are meant, at least are not excluded, that is, the substance of them; as yet being imperfect and unadorned; the expanse not yet made, or the ether and air not yet stretched out; nor any light placed in them, or adorned with the sun, moon, and stars: so the earth is to be understood, not of that properly so called, as separated from the waters, that is, the dry land afterwards made to appear; but the whole mass of earth and water before their separation, and when in their unformed and unadorned state, described in the next verse: in short, these words represent the visible heavens and the terraqueous globe, in their chaotic state, as they were first brought into being by almighty power. The &#1492;   prefixed to both words is, as Aben Ezra observes, expressive of notification or demonstration, as pointing at &quot;those&quot; heavens, and &quot;this earth&quot;; and shows that things visible are here spoken of, whatever is above us, or below us to be seen: for in the Arabic language, as he also observes, the word for &quot;heaven&quot;, comes from one which signifies high or aboveF1&quot;altus fuit, eminuit&quot;, Golius, col. 1219. ; as that for &quot;earth&quot; from one that signifies low and beneath, or underF2&quot;quicquid humile, inferum et depressum&quot; ib. col. 70. Hottinger. Smegma Orient. c. 5. p. 70. & Thesaur. Philolog. l. 1. c. 2. p. 234. . Now it was the matter or substance of these that was first created; for the word &#1488;&#1514;   set before them signifies substance, as both Aben Ezra andF3Sepher Shorash. rad. &#1488;&#1514; .  Kimchi affirm. MaimonidesF4Moreh Nevochim, par. 2. c. 30. p. 275, 276.  observes, that this particle, according to their wise men, is the same as &quot;with&quot;; and then the sense is, God created with the heavens whatsoever are in the heavens, and with the earth whatsoever are in the earth; that is, the substance of all things in them; or all things in them were seminally together: for so he illustrates it by an husbandman sowing seeds of divers kinds in the earth, at one and the same time; some of which come up after one day, and some after two days, and some after three days, though all sown together. These are said to be &quot;created&quot;, that is, to be made out of nothing; for what pre-existent matter to this chaos could there be out of which they could be formed? And the apostle says, &quot;through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear&quot;, Hebrews 11:3 . And though this word is sometimes used, and even in this chapter, of the production of creatures out of pre-existent matter, as in Genesis 1:21   yet, as Nachmanides observes, there is not in the holy language any word but this here used, by which is signified the bringing anything into being out of nothing; and many of the Jewish interpreters, as Aben Ezra, understand by creation here, a production of something into being out of nothing; and Kimchi saysF5Ut supra. (Sepher Shorash.) rad. &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;    that creation is a making some new thing, and a bringing something out of nothing: and it deserves notice, that this word is only used of God; and creation must be the work of God, for none but an almighty power could produce something out of nothing. The word used is Elohim&#246;, which some derive from another, which signifies power, creation being an act of almighty power: but it is rather to be derived from the root in the Arabic language, which signifies to worshipF6&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;   &quot;coluit, unde&quot; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;   &quot;numen colendum&quot;, Schultens in Job. i. 1. Golius, col. 144. Hottinger. Smegma, p. 120. , God being the object of all religious worship and adoration; and very properly does Moses make use of this appellation here, to teach us, that he who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth is the sole object of worship; as he was of the worship of the Jewish nation, at the head of which Moses was. It is in the plural number, and being joined to a verb of the singular, is thought by many to be designed to point unto us the mystery of a plurality, or trinity of persons in the unity of the divine essence: but whether or no this is sufficient to support that doctrine, which is to be established without it; yet there is no doubt to be made, that all the three Persons in the Godhead were concerned in the creation of all things, see Psalm 33:6 . The Heathen poet Orpheus has a notion somewhat similar to this, who writes, that all things were made by one Godhead of three names, and that this God is all thingsF7See the Universal History, vol. 1. p. 33. : and now all these things, the heaven and the earth, were made by God &quot;in the beginning&quot;, either in the beginning of time, or when time began, as it did with the creatures, it being nothing but the measure of a creature's duration, and therefore could not be until such existed; or as Jarchi interprets it, in the beginning of the creation, when God first began to create; and is best explained by our Lord, &quot;the beginning of the creation which God created&quot;, Mark 13:19   and the sense is, either that as soon as God created, or the first he did create were the heavens and the earth; to which agrees the Arabic version; not anything was created before them: or in connection with the following words, thus, &quot;when first&quot;, or &quot;in the beginning&quot;, when &quot;God created the heavens and the earth&quot;, then &quot;the earth was without form&quot;, &cF8So Vatablus. . The Jerusalem Targum renders it, &quot;in wisdom God created&quot;; see Proverbs 3:19   and some of the ancients have interpreted it of the wisdom of God, the Logos and Son of God. From hence we learn, that the world was not eternal, either as to the matter or form of it, as Aristotle, and some other philosophers, have asserted, but had a beginning; and that its being is not owing to the fortuitous motion and conjunction of atoms, but to the power and wisdom of God, the first cause and sole author of all things; and that there was not any thing created before the heaven and the earth were: hence those phrases, before the foundation of the world, and before the world began, &c. are expressive of eternity: this utterly destroys the notion of the pre-existence of the souls of men, or of the soul of the Messiah: false therefore is what the Jews sayF9Targum Jon. & Jerus. in Gen. iii. 24. T. Bab. Pesachim, fol. 54. 1. & Nedarim, fol. 39. 2. , that paradise, the righteous, Israel, Jerusalem, &c. were created before the world; unless they mean, that these were foreordained by God to be, which perhaps is their sense. </p>

<p>And the earth was without form, and void ,.... It was not in the form it now is, otherwise it must have a form, as all matter has; it was a fluid matter, the watery parts were not separated from the earthy ones; it was not put into the form of a terraqueous globe it is now, the sea apart, and the earth by itself, but were mixed and blended together; it was, as both the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase it, a waste and desert, empty and destitute of both men and beasts; and it may be added, of fishes and fowls, and also of trees, herbs, and plants. It was, as OvidF11&quot;Quem dixere chaos, rudis indigestaque moles&quot;, Ovid Metamorph. l. 1. Fab. 1.  calls it, a chaos and an indigested mass of matter; and HesiodF12   &#951;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#956;&#949;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#967;&#945;&#959;&#962;  &c. Hesiodi Theogonia.  makes a chaos first to exist, and then the wide extended earth, and so OrpheusF13Orphei Argonautica, ver. 12. , and others; and this is agreeably to the notion of various nations. The Chinese make a chaos to be the beginning of all things, out of which the immaterial being (God) made all things that consist of matter, which they distinguish into parts they call Yin and Yang, the one signifying hidden or imperfect, the other open or perfectF14Martin. Sinic. Hist. l. 1. p. 5. : and so the Egyptians, according to Diodorus SiculusF15Bibliothec. l. 1. p. 7. , whose opinion he is supposed to give, thought the system of the universe had but one form; the heaven and earth, and the nature of them, being mixed and blended together, until by degrees they separated and obtained the form they now have: and the Phoenicians, as SanchoniathoF16Apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 2. c. 10. p. 33.  relates, supposed the principle of the universe to be a dark and windy air, or the blast of a dark air, and a turbid chaos surrounded with darkness, as follows, </p>
<p> and darkness was upon the face of the deep : the whole fluid mass of earth and water mixed together. This abyss is explained by waters in the next clause, which seem to be uppermost; and this was all a dark turbid chaos, as before expressed, without any light or motion, till an agitation was made by the Spirit, as is next observed: </p>
<p> and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters , which covered the earth, Psalm 104:6   the earthy particles being heaviest sunk lower, and the waters being lighter rose up above the others: hence ThalesF17Laert. in Vita Thaletis, p. 18. Cicero do Natura Deorum, l. 1.  the philosopher makes water to be the beginning of all things, as do the Indian BrahmansF18Strabo. Geograph. l. 15. p. 491. : and AristotleF19Metaphysic. l. 1. c. 3.  himself owns that this was the most ancient opinion concerning the origin of the universe, and observes, that it was not only the opinion of Thales, but of those that were the most remote from the then present generation in which he lived, and of those that first wrote on divine things; and it is frequent in Hesiod and Homer to make Oceanus, or the ocean, with Tethys, to be the parents of generation: and so the Scriptures represent the original earth as standing out of the water, and consisting of it, 2 Peter 3:5   and upon the surface of these waters, before they were drained off the earth, &quot;the Spirit of God moved&quot;; which is to be understood not of a wind, as Onkelos, Aben Ezra, and many Jewish writers, as well as Christians, interpret it; since the air, which the wind is a motion of, was not made until the second day. The Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem call it the spirit of mercies; and by it is meant the Spirit of the Messiah, as many Jewish writersF20Zohar in Gen. fol. 107. 3. and fol. 128. 3. Bereshit Rabba, fol. 2. 4. and 6. 3. Vajikra Rabba, sect. 14. fol. 156. 4. Baal Hatturim in loc. Caphtor Uperah, fol. 113. 2.  call him; that is, the third Person in the blessed Trinity, who was concerned in the creation of all things, as in the garnishing of the heavens, so in bringing the confused matter of the earth and water into form and order; see Job 26:13 . This same Spirit &quot;moved&quot; or broodedF21&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1508;&#1514;   &quot;incubabat&quot;, Junius, Tremellius, Piscator, &quot;as a dove on her young&quot;, T. Bab. Chagigah, fol. 15. 1.  upon the face of the waters, to impregnate them, as an hen upon eggs to hatch them, so he to separate the parts which were mixed together, and give them a quickening virtue to produce living creatures in them. This sense and idea of the word are finely expressed by our poetF23----and, with mighty wings outspread, Dovelike satst brooding on the vast abyss, And mad'st it pregnant.---- Milton's Paradise Lost, B. 1. l. 20, 21, 22. The same sentiment is in B. 7. l. 234, 235. . Some traces of this appear in the    &#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;  or mind of Anaxagoras, which when all things were mixed together came and set them in orderF24Laert. in Vita Anaxagor. p. 91. Euseb. Evangel. Praepar. l. 10. c. 14. p. 504. ; and the &quot;mens&quot; of Thales he calls God, which formed all things out of waterF25Cicero de Nat. Deorum, l. 1. Lactant, de falsa Relig. l. 1. c. 5. ; and the &quot;spiritus intus alit&quot;, &c. of Virgil; and with this agrees what Hermes says, that there was an infinite darkness in the abyss or deep, and water, and a small intelligent spirit, endued with a divine power, were in the chaosF26Apud Drusium in loc. : and perhaps from hence is the mundane egg, or egg of OrpheusF1Hymn.    &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957; , ver. 1, 2. : or the firstborn or first laid egg, out of which all things were formed; and which he borrowed from the Egyptians and Phoenicians, and they perhaps from the Jews, and which was reckoned by them a resemblance of the world. The Egyptians had a deity they called Cneph, out of whose mouth went forth an egg, which they interpreted of the worldF2Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 3. c. 11. p. 115. : and the Zophasemin of the Phoenicians, which were heavenly birds, were, according to SanchoniathoF3Apud Ib. l. 2. c. 10. p. 33. , of the form of an egg; and in the rites of Bacchus they worshipped an egg, as being an image of the world, as MacrobiusF4Saturnal. l. 7. c. 16.  says; and therefore he thought the question, whether an hen or an egg was oldest, was of some moment, and deserved consideration: and the Chinese sayF5Martin. Sinic. Hist. l. 1. p. 3, 4. , that the first man was produced out of the chaos as from an egg, the shell of which formed the heavens, the white the air, and the yolk the earth; and to this incubation of the spirit, or wind, as some would have it, is owing the windy egg of AristophanesF6In Avibus. . (Thomas Chamlers (1780-1847) in 1814 was the first to purpose that there is a gap between verse 1 and 2. Into this gap he places a pre-Adamic age, about which the scriptures say nothing. Some great catastrophe took place, which left the earth &quot;without form and void&quot; or ruined, in which state it remained for as many years as the geologist required.F7Ian Taylor, p. 363, 364, &quot;In the Minds of Men&quot;, 1984, TEF Publishing, P.O. Box 5015, Stn. F, Toronto, Canada.  This speculation has been popularised by the 1917 Scofield Reference Bible. However, the numerous rock layers that are the supposed proof for these ages, were mainly laid down by Noah's flood. In Exodus 20:11   we read of a literal six day creation. No gaps, not even for one minute, otherwise these would not be six normal days. Also, in Romans 5:12   we read that death is the result of Adam's sin. Because the rock layers display death on a grand scale, they could not have existed before the fall of Adam. There is no direct evidence that the earth is much older than six thousand years. However, we have the direct eyewitness report of God himself that he made everything in six days. Tracing back through the biblical genealogies we can determine the age of the universe to be about six thousand years with an error of not more than two per cent. </p>

<p>And God said ,.... This phrase is used, nine times in this account of the creation; it is admired by Longinus the Heathen in his treatise &quot;of the Sublime&quot;, as a noble instance of it; and it is most beautifully paraphrased and explained in Psalm 33:6   as expressive of the will, power, authority, and efficacy of the divine Being; whose word is clothed with power, and who can do, and does whatever he will, and as soon as he pleases; his orders are always obeyed. Perhaps the divine Person speaking here is the Logos or Word of God, which was in the beginning with God, and was God, and who himself is the light that lightens every creature. The words spoke were, </p>
<p> let there be light, and there was light : it at once appeared; &quot;God commanded light to shine out of darkness&quot;; as the apostle says, 2 Corinthians 4:6   this was the first thing made out of the dark chaos; as in the new creation, or work of grace in the heart, light is the first thing produced there: what this light was is not easy to say. Some of the Jewish Rabbins, and also some Christian writers, think the angels are designed by it, which is not at all probable, as the ends and use of this light show: others of them are of opinion, that it is the same with the sun, of which a repetition is made on the fourth day, because of its use and efficacy to the earth, and its plants; but others more rightly take it to be different from the sun, and a more glimmering light, which afterwards was gathered into and perfected in the body of the sunF6Vid. Menasseh ben Israel conciliator in Gen. qu. 2. . It is the opinion of ZanchiusF7De Operibus Dei, par. 3. l. 1. c. 2. col. 239. and l. 2. c. 1. , and which is approved of by our countryman, Mr. FullerF8Miscell. Sacr. l. 1. c. 12. , that it was a lucid body, or a small lucid cloud, which by its circular motion from east to west made day and nightF9Milton seems to be of the same mind:----- -----and forthwith light. Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure, Sprung from the deep, and from her native east To journey thro' the airy gloom began, Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle Sojourned the while.----- Paradise Lost, B. 7. l. 243, &c. ; perhaps somewhat like the cloudy pillar of fire that guided the Israelites in the wilderness, and had no doubt heat as well as light; and which two indeed, more or less, go together; and of such fiery particles this body may well be thought to consist. The word &quot;Ur&quot; signifies both fire and light. </p>

<p>And God saw the light, that it was good ,.... Very pleasant and delightful, useful and beneficial; that is, he foresaw it would be good, of great service, as PicherellusF11In Cosmopoeiam, p. 267.  interprets it; for as yet there were no inhabitants of the earth to receive any advantage by it; see Ecclesiastes 11:7   besides, it was doubtless good to answer some present purposes, to prepare for the work of the two following days, before the great luminary was formed; as to dispel the darkness of heaven, and that which covered the deep; to rarefy, exhale, and draw up the lighter parts of the chaos, in order to form the wide extended ether, the expanded air, and the surrounding atmosphere, while the Spirit of God was agitating the waters, and separating them from the earthy parts; and which also might serve to unite and harden those which were to form the dry land, and also to warm that when it appeared, that it might bring forth grass, herbs, and fruit trees: </p>
<p> and God divided the light from the darkness : by which it should seem that they were mixed together, the particles of light and darkness; but &quot;by what way is the light parted&quot;, severed and divided from darkness, is a question put to men by the Lord himself, who only can answer it, Job 38:24   he has so divided one from the other that they are not together at the same place and time; when light is in one hemisphere, darkness is in the otherF12Milton in the place above referred to says, it was divided by the hemisphere. Paradise Lost, B. 7. l. 243, &c. ; and the one by certain constant revolutions is made to succeed the other; and by the motion of the one, the other gives way; as well as also God has divided and distinguished them by calling them by different names, as Aben Ezra, and is what next follows: </p>
<h2 pb_toc="index">1:5</h2>
<p><pb_sync type='verse' value="Genesis 1:5" display="now" /><b>Gen 1:5</b></p>


<p>And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night ,.... Either by the circulating motion of the above body of light, or by the rotation of the chaos on its own axis towards it, in the space of twenty four hours there was a vicissitude of light and darkness; just as there is now by the like motion either of the sun, or of the earth; and which after this appellation God has given, we call the one, day, and the other, night: </p>
<p> and the evening and the morning were the first day : the evening, the first part of the night, or darkness, put for the whole night, which might be about the space of twelve hours; and the morning, which was the first part of the day, or light, put also for the whole, which made the same space, and both together one natural day, consisting of twenty four hours; what Daniel calls an &quot;evening morning&quot;, Daniel 8:26   and the apostle    &#957;&#965;&#967;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; , a &quot;night day&quot;, 2 Corinthians 11:25 . Thales being asked which was first made, the night or the day, answered, the night was before one dayF13Laert. in Vita Thaletis. p. 24. . The Jews begin their day from the preceding evening; so many other nations: the Athenians used to reckon their day from sun setting to sun settingF14Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 77. ; the Romans from the middle of the night, to the middle of the night following, as GelliusF15Noct. Attic. l. 3. c. 2.  relates; and TacitusF16De Mor. German. c. 11.  reports of the ancient Germans, that they used to compute not the number of days, but of nights, reckoning that the night led the day. CaesarF17Commentar. l. 6. p. 141.  observes of the ancient Druids in Britain, that they counted time not by the number of days, but nights; and observed birthdays, and the beginnings of months and years, so as that the day followed the night; and we have some traces of this still among us, as when we say this day se'nnight, or this day fortnight. This first day of the creation, according to James Capellus, was the eighteenth of April; but, according to Bishop Usher, the twenty third of October; the one beginning the creation in the spring, the other in autumn. It is a notion of Mr. Whiston's, that the six days of the creation were equal to six years, a day and a year being one and the same thing before the fall of man, when the diurnal rotation of the earth about its axis, as he thinks, began; and in agreement with this, very remarkable is the doctrine Empedocles taught, that when mankind sprung originally from the earth, the length of the day, by reason of the slowness of the sun's motion, was equal to ten of our present monthsF18Vid. Universal History, vol. 1. p. 79. . The Hebrew word &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; , &quot;Ereb&quot;, rendered &quot;evening&quot;, is retained by some of the Greek poets, as by HesiodF19   &#949;&#954; &#967;&#945;&#949;&#959;&#962; &#948;'&#949;&#961;&#949;&#946;&#959;&#962; , &c. Hesiod. Theogonia. , who says, out of the &quot;chaos&quot; came &quot;Erebus&quot;, and black night, and out of the night ether and the day; and AristophanesF20   &#967;&#945;&#959;&#962; &#951;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#957;&#965;&#958; &#949;&#961;&#949;&#946;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#949; &#956;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#957;  &c. Aristophanes in Avibus. , whose words are, </p>
<p> chaos, night, and black &quot;Erebus&quot; were first, and wide Tartarus, but there were neither earth, air, nor heaven, but in the infinite bosom of Erebus, black winged night first brought forth a windy egg, &c. And OrpheusF21Hymn. 2. ver. 2.  makes night to be the beginning of all things. (Hugh Miller (1802-1856) was the first person to popularise the &quot;Day-Age&quot; theory. In his book, &quot;Testimony of the Rocks&quot;, that was published in the year after his untimely death, he speculated that that the days were really long ages. He held that Noah's flood was a local flood and the rock layers were laid down long periods of time.F22Ian Taylor, p. 360-362, &quot;In the Minds of Men&quot;, 1984, TEV Publishing, P.O.

These are the stories in the heavens the Scriptures speak of, Amos 9:6   and the air is divided by philosophers into higher, middle, and lower regions: and so the Targum of Jonathan places this firmament or expanse between the extremities of the heaven, and the waters of the ocean. The word in the Syriac language has the sense of binding and compressingF24Vid. Castell. Lex. col. 3647. Fuller. Miscell. Sacr. l. 1. c. 6. ; and so it is used in the Syriac version of Luke 6:38   and may denote the power of the air when formed in compressing the chaos, and dividing and separating the parts of it; and which it now has in compressing the earth, and the several parts that are in it, and by its compression preserves them and retains them in their proper placesF25Vid.

<p>And God made the firmament ,.... By a word speaking, commanding it into being, producing it out of the chaos, and spreading it in that vast space between the heaven of heavens and our earthF26------and God made The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, Transparent, elemental air, diffused In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great round.------ Milton, Paradise Lost, B. 7. l. 263, &c. , </p>
<p> And divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament ; the lower part of it, the atmosphere above, which are the clouds full of water, from whence rain descends upon the earth; and which divided between them and those that were left on the earth, and so under it, not yet gathered into one place; as it now does between the clouds of heaven and the waters of the sea. Though Mr. GregoryF1Notes and Observations, &c. c. 23. p. 110, &c.  is of opinion, that an abyss of waters above the most supreme orb is here meant; or a great deep between the heavens and the heaven of heavens, where, as in storehouses, the depth is laid up; and God has his treasures of snow, hail, and rain, and from whence he brought out the waters which drowned the world at the universal deluge. Others suppose the waters above to be the crystalline heaven, which for its clearness resembles water; and which MiltonF2Ibid. l. 291.  calls the &quot;crystalline ocean&quot;, </p>

<p> and the evening; and the morning were the second day ; these together made up the space of twenty four hours, which was another natural day; the body of light, created on the first day, having again moved round the chaos in that space of time; or else the chaos had turned round on its own axis in that time, which revolution produced a second day; and which, according to Capellus, was the nineteenth of April, and according to Bishop Usher the twenty fourth of October. It is an observation that everyone may make, that the phrase, </p>
<p> and God saw that it was good , is not used at the close of this day's work, as of the rest: the reason some Jewish writers give is, because the angels fell on this day; but it is a much better which Jarchi gives, and that is, because the work of the waters was not finished; it was begun on the second day, and perfected on the thirdF4Vid.

<p>And God made two great lights ,.... This was his own work which he himself did, and not by another; and may be particularly observed to express the folly of idolaters in worshipping these luminaries which were the creations of God, and were placed by him in the heaven to serve some purposes on earth beneficial to men, but not to be worshipped. These two &quot;great lights&quot; are the sun and the moon; and they may well be called great, especially the former, for the diameter of the sun is reckoned to be about eight hundred thousand miles. According to Mr. DerhamF9Astro-Theology, B. 1. c. 2. & B. 6. c. 2.  its apparent diameter is computed at 822,145 English miles, its ambit at 2,582,873 miles, and its solid contents at 290,971,000,000,000,000: the lowest account makes the sun a hundred thousand times bigger than the earth; and according to Sir Isaac Newton it is 900,000 bigger. The moon's diameter is to that of the earth is about twenty seven per cent, or 2175 miles, its surface contains fourteen hundred thousand square milesF11Chambers's Dictionary in the word &quot;Moon&quot;. : it is called great, not on account of its corporeal quantity, for it is the least of all the planets excepting Mercury, but because of its quality, as a light, it reflecting more light upon the earth than any besides the sun, </p>
<p> The greater light to rule the day : not to rule men, though the heathens have worshipped it under the names of Molech and Baal, which signify king and lord, as if it was their lord and king to whom they were to pay homage; but to rule the day, to preside over it, to make it, give light in it, and continue it to its proper length; and in which it rules alone, the moon, nor any of the other planets then appearing: this is called the &quot;greater&quot; light, in comparison of the moon, not only with respect to its body or substance, but on account of its light, which is far greater and stronger than that of the moon; and which indeed receives its light from it, the moon being, as is generally said, an opaque body: </p>
<p> and the lesser light to rule the night ; to give light then, though in a fainter, dimmer way, by reflecting it from the sun; and it rules alone, the sun being absent from the earth, and is of great use to travellers and sailors; it is called the lesser light, in comparison of the sun. Astronomers are of opinion, as CalmetF12Dictionary in the word &quot;Moon&quot;.  observes, that it is about fifty two times smaller than the earth, and four thousand one hundred and fifty times smaller than the sun; but these proportions are otherwise determined by the generality of modern astronomers: however, they all agree that the moon is abundantly less than the sun; and that it is as a light, we all know, </p>
<p> He made the stars also ; to rule by night, Psalm 136:9   not only the planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, but the vast numbers of stars with which the heavens are bespangled, and which reflect some degree of light upon the earth; with the several constellations, some of which the Scriptures speak of, as Arcturus, Orion, Pleiades, and the chambers of the south, Job 9:9 , Job 38:31   though some restrain this to the five planets only.

<p> On the fourth day the luminaries came into existence. Since God has foreknowledge, he understood the nonsense of the foolish philosophers who were going to say that the things produced on earth came from the stars, so that they might set God aside. In order therefore that the truth might be demonstrated, plants and seeds came into existence before stars. For what comes into existence later cannot cause what is prior to it.' </p>

<p>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven ,.... He not only ordered that there they should be, and made them that there they might be, but he placed them there with his own hands; and they are placed, particularly the sun, at such a particular distance as to be beneficial and not hurtful: had it been set nearer to the earth, its heat would have been intolerable; and had it been further off it would have been of no use; in the one case we should have been scorched with its heat, and in the other been frozen up for the want of it. The various expressions used seem to be designed on purpose to guard against and expose the vanity of the worship of the sun and moon; which being visible, and of such great influence and usefulness to the earth, were the first the Heathens paid adoration to, and was as early as the times of Job, Job 31:26   and yet these were but creatures made by God, his servants and agents under him, and therefore to worship them was to serve the creature besides the Creator, </p>
<p> To give light upon the earth ; this is repeated from Genesis 1:15   to show the end for which they were made, and set up, and the use they were to be of to the earth; being hung up like so many lamps or chandeliers, to contain and send forth light unto the earth, to the inhabitants of it, that they may see to walk and work by, and do all the business of life, as well as be warmed and comforted thereby, and the earth made fertile to bring forth its precious fruits for the use of creatures in it: and it is marvellous that such light should be emitted from the sun, when it is at such a vast distance from the earth, and should reach it in so short a space. A modern astronomerF13Huygen. Cosmotheoros. l. 2. p. 125.  observes, that a bullet discharged from a cannon would be near twenty five years, before it could finish its journey from the sun to the earth: and yet the rays of light reach the earth in seven minutes and a half, and are said to pass ten millions of miles in a minute. </p>

<p> and every winged fowl after his kind ; every fowl, and the various sorts of them that fly in the air; these were all created by God, or produced out of the water and out of the earth by his wonderful power: </p>
<p> and God saw that it was good ; or foresaw that those creatures he made in the waters and in the air would serve to display the glory of his perfections, and be very useful and beneficial to man, he designed to create. (Some of the creatures described by the ancients must refer to animals that are now extinct. Some of these may have been very large dinasours. Ed.) </p>

<p> saying, be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas : and these creatures do multiply exceedingly, and vast quantities there are of them in the mighty waters, though the consumption of some sorts of them is very great.

<p>And God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind ,.... All sorts of living creatures that live and move upon the earth; not that the earth was endued with a power to produce these creatures of itself, without the interposition of God: for though it might be impregnated with a quickening virtue by the Spirit of God, which moved on it whilst a fluid, and had been prepared and disposed for such a production by the heat of the body of light created on the first day, and of the sun on the fourth; yet no doubt it was by the power of God accompanying his word, that these creatures were produced of the earth, and formed into their several shapes. The Heathens had some traditionary notion of this affair: according to the Egyptians, whose sentiments Diodorus SiculusF3Bibliothec. l. 1. p. 7.  seems to give us, the process was thus carried on; the earth being stiffened by the rays of the sun, and the moist matter being made fruitful by the genial heat, at night received nourishment by the mist which fell from the ambient air; and in the day was consolidated by the heat of the sun, till at length the enclosed foetus having arrived to a perfect increase, and the membranes burnt and burst, creatures of all kinds appeared; of whom those that had got a greater degree of heat went upwards, and became flying fowl; those that were endued with an earthly concretion were reckoned in the class or order of reptiles, and other terrestrial animals; and those that chiefly partook of a moist or watery nature, ran to the place of a like kind, and were called swimmers or fish. This is the account they give; and somewhat like is that which Archelaus, the master of Socrates, delivers as his notion, that animals were produced out of slime, through the heat of the earth liquefying the slime like milk for foodF4Laert. in Vita Archelai, p. 99. : and Zeno the Stoic saysF5Ib. in Vita Zenonis, p. 524. , the grosser part of the watery matter of the world made the earth, the thinner part the air, and that still more subtilized, the fire; and then out of the mixture of these proceeded plants and animals, and all the other kinds; but all this they seem to suppose to be done by the mere efforts of nature; whereas Moses here most truly ascribes their production to the all powerful Word of God: </p>
<p> cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the earth after his kind ; the living creatures produced out of the earth are distinguished into three sorts; &quot;cattle&quot;, which seem to design tame cattle, and such as are for the use of man, either for carriage, food, or clothing, as horses, asses, camels, oxen, sheep, &c. and &quot;creeping&quot; things, which are different from the creeping things in the sea before mentioned, are such as either have no feet, and go upon their bellies, or are very short, and seem to do so, whether greater or lesser, as serpents, worms, ants, &c, </p>
<p> and the beast of the earth  seems to design wild beasts, such as lions, bears, wolves, &c, </p>
<p> and it was so ; such creatures were immediately produced. </p>

<p>And God made the beast of the earth after his kind ,.... The wild beasts, and the several sorts of them; beginning the account with the last mentioned, as is frequent in the Hebrew language, and so he made all the rest: </p>
<p> and cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind ; tame creatures, and all the reptiles of the earth: this most clearly shows and proves that the above creatures were not produced by the mere force of nature, or the powers the earth were possessed of, however the matter of it might be disposed and prepared, but by the omnipotent hand of God: </p>
<p> and God saw that it was good ; that every creature he had made would some way or other be for his glory, and for the benefit of man. Picherellus thinks that all this belongs to the work of the fifth day, not the sixth; because as the vegetables, herbs, and trees were produced on the same day, the third day; so animals, whether in the waters, air, or earth, were made on one and the same day; and that it was proper a separate day should be allotted for the formation of rational creatures, Adam and Eve, and that it might appear that the same blessing was not conferred on brutes as on reasonable beings; and therefore the words with which Genesis 1:24   begins should be rendered, &quot;but after God had said, let the earth&quot;, &c. that is, after God had ordered this, and it was done, then &quot;the evening and the morning were the fifth day&quot;; which is what rhetoricians call an &quot;hysteron proteron&quot;. </p>

<p>And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness ,.... These words are directed not to the earth, out of which man was made, as consulting with it, and to be assisting in the formation of man, as Moses Gerundensis, and other Jewish writersF6Vet. Nizzachon, p. 5. Lipman. Carmen Memorial. p. 108. apud Wagenseil. Tela ignea, vol. 1. , which is wretchedly stupid; nor to the angels, as the Targum of Jonathan, Jarchi, and others, who are not of God's privy council, nor were concerned in any part of the creation, and much less in the more noble part of it: nor are the words spoken after the manner of kings, as Saadiah, using the plural number as expressive of honour and majesty; since such a way of speaking did not obtain very early, not even till the close of the Old Testament: but they are spoken by God the Father to the Son and Holy Ghost, who were each of them concerned in the creation of all things, and particularly of man: hence we read of divine Creators and Makers in the plural number, Job 35:10   and Philo the Jew acknowledges that these words declare a plurality, and are expressive of others, being co-workers with God in creationF7De confusione Ling. p. 344. De Profugis, p. 460. De Opificio, p. 16. : and man being the principal part of the creation, and for the sake of whom the world, and all things in it were made, and which being finished, he is introduced into it as into an house ready prepared and furnished for him; a consultation is held among the divine Persons about the formation of him; not because of any difficulty attending it, but as expressive of his honour and dignity; it being proposed he should be made not in the likeness of any of the creatures already made, but as near as could be in the likeness and image of God. The Jews sometimes say, that Adam and Eve were created in the likeness of the holy blessed God, and his ShechinahF8Tikkune Zohar, correct. 64. fol. 98. 2. ; and they also speakF9Ibid. correct. 70. fol. 119. 1.  of Adam Kadmon the ancient Adam, as the cause of causes, of whom it is said, &quot;I was as one brought up with him (or an artificer with him), Proverbs 8:30   and to this ancient Adam he said, &quot;let us make man in our image, after our likeness&quot;: and again, &quot;let us make man&quot;; to whom did he say this? the cause of causes said to &quot;`jod', he, `vau', he&quot;; that is, to Jehovah, which is in the midst of the ten numerations. What are the ten numerations? &quot;`aleph', he, `jod', he&quot;, that is, &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; , &quot;I am that I am, Exodus 3:14   and he that says let us make, is Jehovah; I am the first, and I am the last, and beside me there is no God: and three jods &#1497;&#1497;&#1497;   testify concerning him, that there is none above him, nor any below him, but he is in the middle: </p>
<p> and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air ; that is, to catch them, and eat them; though in the after grant of food to man, no mention as yet is made of any other meat than the herbs and fruits of the earth; yet what can this dominion over fish and fowl signify, unless it be a power to feed upon them? It may be observed, that the plural number is used, &quot;let them&quot;, which shows that the name &quot;man&quot; is general in the preceding clause, and includes male and female, as we find by the following verse man was created: </p>
<p> and over the cattle, and over all the earth ; over the tame creatures, either for food, or clothing, or carriage, or for all of them, some of them for one thing, and some for another; and over all the wild beasts of the earth, which seem to be meant by the phrase, &quot;over all the earth&quot;; that is, over all the beasts of the earth, as appears by comparing it with Genesis 1:24   so as to keep them in awe, and keep them off from doing them any damage: </p>
<p> and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; to make use of it as should seem convenient for them. </p>

<p>So God created man in his own image ,.... Which consisted both in the form of his body, and the erect stature of it, different from all other creatures; in agreement with the idea of that body, prepared in covenant for the Son of God, and which it was therein agreed he should assume in the fulness of time; and in the immortality of his soul, and in his intellectual powers, and in that purity, holiness, and righteousness in which he was created; as well as in his dominion, power, and authority over the creatures, in which he was as God's viceregent, and resembled him. The Jerusalem Targum is, </p>
<p> the Word of the Lord created man in his likeness; even that Word that was in the beginning with God, and was God, and in time became incarnate, by whom all things were made, John 1:1 . </p>
<p> in the image of God created he him ; which is repeated for the certainty of it, and that it might be taken notice of, as showing man's superior glory and dignity to the rest of the creatures, 1 Corinthians 11:7 . </p>
<p> male and female created he them ; not that man was created an hermaphrodite, or with two bodies, back to back united together, and afterwards cleaved asunder, as the Jews fabulously say; but first God made man, or the male, out of the dust of the earth, and infused a rational soul into him; and then out of one of his ribs made a female, or woman, who was presented to him as his wife, that so their species might be propagated; and only one male and one female were created, to show that hereafter a man was to have at a time no more wives than one; see Malachi 2:15   for all that is said in the following chapter, concerning the formation of man out of the dust of the earth, and the making of woman out of his rib, and presenting her to him, and his taking her to be his wife, were all done on this sixth day, and at this time. It is a tradition among the Heathens, that man was made last of all the creatures; so says PlatoF11Protagor. p. 320, 321. ; and this notion the Chinese also haveF12Martin. Sinic. Hist. l. 1. p. 4. . The Jews give these reasons why man was made on the evening of the sabbath, to show that he did not assist in the work of creation; and that if he was elated in his mind, it might be told him that a fly was created before him, and that he might immediately enter on the command, i.e. of the sabbathF13T.

<p> and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; all but the tree of knowledge, of good and evil, afterwards excepted; and both these take in all kind of vegetables, all herbs, plants, roots, even corn, wheat, barley, pease, beans, &c. and the various fruits of all sorts of trees, but that before mentioned: </p>

<p>And God saw everything that he had made ,.... Either all that he had made on the several six days of the creation, he took a survey of them, looked over them again, as workmen do when they have finished their work, to see if anything is amiss or wanting; not that anything of this nature can be supposed in the works of God, but such a survey is attributed to him after the manner of men, to show the completeness of his works, and the excellency of them. PicherellusF17In Cosmopoeiam, p. 2841.  limits this to what had been done on this day, with respect to man, who alone, as he thinks, was the subject of this day's work; and so it respects the creation of man after the image and likeness of God; the forming of the woman out of his rib, and so providing a suitable helper for him; giving them dominion over all the creatures, and suitable food for the support of the animal life; and God reflected on this, and foresaw it would be good in the issue, as it was in itself, </p>
<p> And behold, it was very good ; it had been said of everything else, at the close of each day's work, excepting the second, that it was good; but here the expression is stronger upon the creation of man, the chief and principal work of God, that it was &quot;very good&quot;; he being made upright and holy, bearing the image of his Creator upon him, and in such circumstances as to be happy and comfortable himself, and to glorify God: the phrase may be expressive not only of the goodness of everything God had made, as it was in itself, and in its use; but of his complacency, and delight therein, every thing being made for himself and for, his pleasure, Revelation 4:11 . </p>
<p> and the evening and the morning were the sixth day ; by that time all these works on this day were finished; the sun had gone round the earth, or the earth about that, for the space of twenty four hours, which completed the sixth day, within which term of time God had determined to finish all his works, as he did. This day, according to Capellus, was the twenty third of April, and, according, to Archbishop Usher, the twenty eighth of October, or, as others, the sixth of September. Mr. Whiston, as has been before observed, is of opinion, that the six days of the creation were equal to six years: and the Persians have a tradition, which they pretend to have received from Zoroastres, that God created the world, not in six natural days, but in six times or spaces of different length, called in their tongue &quot;Ghahan barha&quot;. The first of these spaces, in which the heavens were created, was a space of forty five days; the second, in which the waters were created, sixty days; the third, in which the earth was created, seventy five days; the fourth, in which grass and trees were created, thirty days; the fifth, in which all creatures were made, eighty days; the sixth, in which man was created, seventy five days; in all three hundred sixty five days, or a full yearF18Hyde Hist. Relig. vet. Pers. p. 164, 166, 168, 483, 484. . The first of the six principal good works they are taught to do is to observe the times of the creationF19Lib. Sad-der, port. 6. 94. apud Hyde, ib. p. 439, 483. . And the ancient Tuscans or Etrurians allot six thousand years to the creation; the order of which, with them, is much the same with the Mosaic account, only making a day a thousand years: in the first thousand, they say, God made the heaven and the earth; in the next, the firmament, which appears to us, calling it heaven; in the third, the sea, and all the waters that are in the earth; in the fourth, the great lights, the sun and moon, and also the stars; in the fifth, every volatile, reptile, and four footed animal, in the air, earth and water, (which agrees with Picherellus); see Gill on Genesis 1:25 , and in the sixth, man; and whereas they say God employed twelve thousand years in all his creation, and the first six being passed at the creation of man, it seems, according to them, that mankind are to continue for the other six thousand yearsF20See Universal History, vol. 1. p. 64. . And it is a notion that obtains among the Jews, that, answerable to the six days of creation, the world will continue six thousand years. It is a tradition of EliasF21T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 97. 1. Avoda Zara, fol. 9. 1. , an ancient Jewish doctor, that </p>
<p> &quot;the world shall stand six thousand years, two thousand void, two thousand under the law, and two thousand, the days of the Messiah.' </p>
<p> And Baal HatturimF23Comment. in Gen. i. 1.  observes, there are six &quot;alephs&quot; in the first verse of this chapter, answerable to the six thousand years the world is to continue: and R. Gedaliah saysF24Shalshelet Hakabala, fol. 36. 1. , at the end of the sixth millennium the world shall return without form and void, (to its former condition, &quot;tohu&quot; and &quot;bohu&quot;,) and the whole shall be a sabbath: and very particular is another writerF25Comment. in Maimon. Hilch. Teshuva, c. 9. sect. 2.  of theirs concerning these six days of the creation, who having spoken of the day of judgment, the resurrection of the dead, and the world to come, observes, that the six days' work is an intimation and sign of these things: on the sixth day man was created, and the work was perfected on the seventh; so the kings of the nations shall be in the world five thousand years, answerable to the five days in which the fowls, and creeping things of the waters, and the rest, were created; and the holding of their kingdoms will be a little within the sixth millennium, answerable to the creation of cattle and beasts, who were now created on the beginning of it, the &quot;sixth day&quot;; and the kingdom of the house of David will be in the sixth millennium, answerable to the creation of man, who knew his Creator, and ruled over them all; and at the end of that millennium will be the day of judgment, answerable to man's being judged at the end of it, &quot;the sixth day; and the seventh millennium will be the sabbath&quot;. And a like notion obtains among the Persian Magi; it is said that Zerdusht, or Zoroastres, was born in the middle age of the world, so it was told him from the age of Keiomaras (the first man) unto thy age are 3000 years, and from this thy age unto the resurrection are 3000 yearsF26Lib.

<p>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished ,.... Perfected and completed in the space of six days, gradually, successively, in the manner before related; by the word and power of God they were on the first day created out of nothing, but they were not perfected, beautified, and adorned, and filled, until all the creatures in the were made: </p>
<p> and all the host them , of the heavens and the earth; the host of heavens are the sun, moon, and stars, often so called in Scripture, and also the angels; see Luke 2:13   wherefore this may be considered as a proof of their creation within the above space of time, probably on the first day, though the Jews commonly say on the second; for if all the host of heaven were made at this time, and angels are at least a part of that host, then they must be then made, or otherwise all the host of heaven were not then and there made, as here affirmed: and the host of the earth, or terraqueous globe, are the plants, herbs, and trees, the fowls, fishes, animals, and man; and these are like hosts or armies, very numerous, and at the command of God, and are marshalled and kept in order by him; even some of the smallest of creatures are his army, which are at his beck, and he can make use of to the annoyance of others, as particularly the locusts are called, Joel 2:11 . </p>

<p>And on the seventh day God ended his work, which he had made ,.... Not that God wrought anything on the seventh day, or finished any part of his work on that day, because he could not then be said to rest from all his work, as be is afterwards twice said to do; and because of this seeming difficulty the Septuagint, Samaritan, and Syriac versions, read, &quot;on the sixth day&quot;. The two latter versions following the former, which so translated for the sake of Ptolemy king of Egypt, as the Jews sayF1T. Bab.

<p>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it ,.... A day in which he took delight and pleasure, having finished all his works, and resting from them, and looking over them as very good; and so he pronounced this day a good and happy day, and &quot;sanctified&quot; or appointed it in his mind to be a day separated from others, for holy service and worship; as it was with the Jews when they became a body of people, both civil and ecclesiastical: or this is all said by way of prolepsis or anticipation, as many things in this chapter are, many names of countries and rivers, by which being called in the times of Moses, are here given them, though they were not called by them so early, nor till many ages after: and according to Jarchi this passage respects future time, when God &quot;blessed&quot; this day with the manna, which descended on all the days of the week, an omer for a man, and on the sixth day double food; and he &quot;sanctified&quot; it with the manna which did not descend at all on that day: besides, these words may be read in a parenthesis, as containing an account of a fact that was done, not at the beginning of the world, and on the first seventh day of it; but of what had been done in the times of Moses, who wrote this, after the giving of the law of the sabbath; and this being given through his hands to the people of Israel, he takes this opportunity here to insert it, and very pertinently, seeing the reason why God then, in the times of Moses, blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it, was, because he had rested on that day from all his works, Exodus 20:11   and the same reason is given here, taken plainly out of that law which he had delivered to them: </p>
<p> because that in it he had rested from all his work, which God created and made ; which shows, that this refers not to the same time when God blessed and hallowed the seventh day, which was done in the times of Moses, but to what had been long before, and was then given as a reason enforcing it; for it is not here said, as in the preceding verse, &quot;he rested&quot;, but &quot;had rested&quot;, even from the foundation of the world, when his works were finished, as in Hebrews 4:3   even what &quot;he created to make&quot;F5&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1493;&#1514;   &quot;creavit ut faceret&quot;, V.

<p>And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth ,.... That is, God made it, even he who made the heavens and the earth; for these words depend upon the preceding, and are in close connection with them; signifying that the plants of the field, which were made out of the earth on the third day, were made before any were planted in it, or any seed was sown therein from whence they could proceed, and therefore must be the immediate production of divine power: </p>
<p> and every herb of the field before it grew : those at once sprung up in perfection out of the earth, before there were any that budded forth, and grew up by degrees to perfection, as herbs do now: </p>
<p> for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth : so that the production of plants and herbs in their first formation could not be owing to that; since on the third day, when they were made, there was no sun to exhale and draw up the waters into the clouds, in order to be let down again in showers of rain: </p>
<p> and there was not a man to till the ground ; who was not created till the sixth day, and therefore could have no concern in the cultivation of the earth, and of the plants and herbs in it; but these were the produce of almighty power, without the use of any means: some Jewish writersF6Zohar in Gen. fol. 32. 4. , by the plant and herb of the field, mystically understand the first and second Messiah, for they sometimes feign two; see Isaiah 4:2 . </p>

Vatablus, Piscator, Pareus, Drusius, Cartwright; &quot;ornaverat plantis&quot;, Junius & Tremellius. , for this was not now done after the formation of man, but before; and so the word translated &quot;eastward&quot; may be rendered, as it is by some, &quot;before&quot;F14&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;   &quot;a principio&quot;, V. L. so Onkelos; &quot;antes vel antequam&quot;, same in Fagius, Cartwright. : for the plain meaning is, that God had planted a garden before he made man, even on the third day, when all herbs, and plants, and trees were produced out of the earth. The whole world was as a garden, in comparison of what it is now since the fall: what then must this spot of ground, this garden be, which was separated and distinguished from the rest, and the more immediate plantation of God, and therefore is called the garden of the Lord, Genesis 13:10   and which PlatoF15In Symposio, apud Euseb. praepar. Evangel. l. 12. c. 11. p. 584.  calls    &#948;&#953;&#959;&#962;     &#954;&#951;&#960;&#959;&#962; , &quot;Jove's garden?&quot; This garden was planted in the country of Eden, so called very probably from its being a very pleasant and delightful country; and though it is not certain, and cannot be said exactly where it was, yet it seems to be a part of Mesopotamia, since it is more than once mentioned with Haran, which was in that country, 2 Kings 19:12   and since it was by the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, when they were become one stream, which ran through this country, and parted again at this garden; and the country there, as HerodotusF16Clio sive, l. 1. c. 193.  says, is the most fruitful he ever saw; and it seems to be much better to place it here than in Armenia, where the fountain of these rivers is said to be: so TournefortF17Voyage to the Levant, vol. 3. p. 161, 162.  thinks it lay in the country, or plain of the three churches (or Ejmiadzit), in Armenia, about twenty French leagues distant from the heads of Euphrates and Araxes, and near as many from the Phasis, a country exceeding pleasant and fruitful. A very learned manF18Nichol. Abrami Pharus Vet. Test. l. 2. c. 16. p. 56. So Texelius (Phoenix, l. 3. c. 7. sect. 7.) takes it to be in the land of Promise, not far from the Dead sea, or sea of Sodom, and in the country about Jordan; and of the same opinion is Heidegger (Hist. Patriarch. Exerc. 4. sect. 42. p. 15.)  is of opinion, that the garden of Eden was in the land of Judea to the east, by the lake of Gennesaret or Tiberias, and the lake of Asphaltites, called the Dead sea, and takes in, in its compass, the famous valley, or the great plain, and the plains of Jericho, and great part of Galilee, and all that tract which Jordan flows by, from Gennesaret to the country of Sodom; and he takes the river Jordan to be &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;  &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; , &quot;the river of Eden&quot;, from whence it has its name of Jordan; and Gennesaret he interprets as if it was &#1490;&#1503;  &#1513;&#1512; , &quot;Gansar&quot;, the garden of the prince, that is, of Adam, the prince of all mankind. He argues from the situation of the place, and the pleasantness and fruitfulness of it, the balsam of Jericho, and other odoriferous plants that grew there, and what are called the apples of paradise: and it must be owned, that this country abounded with gardens and orchards: it is mentioned in the Jewish Misnah, where the commentatorsF19Maimon. & Bartenora in Misn. Maaserot, c. 3. sect. 7.  say, it was a country in the land of Israel, in which were many gardens and orchards, that produced excellent fruit; and the fruits of Gennesaret are spoken of in the TalmudF20T. Bab. Beracot, fol. 44. 1. Erubin, fol. 30. 1. & Pesachim, fol. 8. 2.  as exceeding sweet: and with this agrees the account JosephusF21De Bello Jud. l. 3. c. 9. sect. 8.  gives of it, that it is&quot;wonderful in nature and goodness, and through its fertility refuses no plant; everything is set here; the temper of the air suits with different things; here grow nuts, and more winter fruit; and there palms, which are nourished with heat, and near them figs and olives, which require a softer air--not only it produces apples of different sorts, beyond belief, but long preserves them; and indeed the most excellent of fruit; grapes and figs it furnishes with for ten months, without intermission, and other fruit throughout the whole year, growing old, with them.'And it may be further observed, that it is asked by the Jewish Rabbins, why it is called Genesar? and the answer is, because &#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; , &quot;the gardens of princes&quot;; these are the kings who have gardens in the midst of it: another reason is given, because it belonged to Naphtali, a portion in the midst of it, as it is said, and of &quot;Naphtali a thousand princes&quot;, 1 Chronicles 12:34 .F23Aruch in voce &#1490;&#1504;&#1505;&#1512; , fol. 37. 1.  And it is worthy of remark, that Strabo calls Jericho, which was within this tract, &quot;the paradise of balsam&quot;F24Geograph. l. 16. p. 525. ; and there, and hereabout, as Diodorus SiculusF25Bibliothec. l. 19. p. 734. , and JustinF26E Trogo, l. 36. c. 3.  relate, grew this aromatic plant, and nowhere else; it was not to be found in any other part of the world. And it appears from Scripture, that if the plain of Jordan was not the garden of Eden, it is said to be, &quot;as the garden of the Lord&quot;, Genesis 13:10   and if the &quot;caph&quot; or &quot;as&quot; is not a note of similitude, but of reality, as it sometimes is, it proves it to be the very place; and the above learned writer takes it to be not comparative, but illative, as giving a reason why it was so well watered, because it was the garden of the Lord: and the Jews have some notion of this, for they say, if that the garden of Eden is in the land of Israel, Bethshean is the door of it, or entrance into it; the gloss gives this reason, because the fruits were sweeter than any otherF1T. Bab. Erubin, fol. 19. 1. ; and this was near, at the entrance of the great plain before mentioned; and before which was this place, as Josephus saysF2Antiqu. l. 12. c. 8. sect. 5. 1 Maccab. v. 52. : and if the garden of Eden was in those parts, it may be observed, that where the first Adam first dwelt, and where he sinned and fell, Christ the second Adam frequently was; here he conversed much, taught his doctrines, wrought his miracles; and even here he appeared after his resurrection from the dead. But the opinions of men about this place are very many, and there is scarce any country in the whole world but one or another has placed the garden of Eden in it; nay, some have assigned a place for it out of the earth, in the eighth sphere. Such a garden undoubtedly there was somewhere, and it is said to be placed &quot;eastward&quot;, either in the eastern part of the country of Eden, see Genesis 4:16   or to the east of the desert where Moses was when he wrote; or to the east of Judea, as Mesopotamia was: and if this garden was in Judea, the place assigned for it by the above learned person, it was in the eastern part of that country; see Numbers 32:19 . This garden was an emblem either of the church of Christ on earth, which is a garden enclosed, surrounded with divine power, and distinguished with divine grace; a small spot in comparison of the world; is of Jehovah's planting, and is his property; and is an Eden to his people, where they enjoy much spiritual pleasure and delight: or however of the place and state of the happiness of the saints in the other world, often called a paradise in allusion to this, Luke 23:43   and which is of God's planting, and therefore called the paradise of God, and is an Eden, where are pleasures for evermore: and this seems to be what the Jews mean when they sayF3T. Bab. Pesachim, fol. 54. 1. Nedarim, fol. 39. 2. , that the garden of Eden, or paradise, was created before the world was; which is no other than what Christ says of it in other words, Matthew 25:34 . </p>
<p> and there he put the man whom he had formed ; not as soon as he had planted the garden, but as soon as he had made man; and from hence it is generally concluded, that man was made without the garden, and brought from the place where he was formed, and put into it; and which some say was near Damascus: but be it where it will, it is most probable that it was not far from the garden; though there seems no necessity for supposing him to be made out of it; for the putting him into it may signify the appointing and ordering him to be there, and fixing and settling him in it, for the ends and uses mentioned, see Genesis 2:15 . (After the global destruction of Noah's flood, it is doubtful that the location of the Garden of Eden could be determined with any degree of certainty today. Ed.) </p>

<p>And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food ,.... That is, out of the ground of the garden of Eden; and this was done on the third day, when the whole earth brought forth grass, herbs, and trees: but a peculiar spot of ground was fixed on for man, and stocked with trees of all sorts for his use, not only to bear fruit, which would be suitable and agreeable food for him, but others also, which would yield him delight to look at; such as the tall cedars for their loftiness, spreading branches and green leaves, with many others; so that not only there were trees to gratify the senses of tasting and smelling, but that of sight; and such a sightly goodly tree to look at was the tree of knowledge, Genesis 3:6 . These trees may be an emblem of the saints, the trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, and made to grow by him through the influence of his Spirit and grace; and whom he plants in his gardens, the churches, and transplants into the heavenly paradise, and are often compared to palm trees, cedars, olive trees, pomegranates, &c. </p>
<p> the tree of life also in the midst of the garden ; set there as in the most excellent place, where it might be most conspicuous, and to be come at; for before Adam sinned, as there was no prohibition of his eating of it, so there was no obstruction to it; and as he had a grant to eat of it, with the other trees, it was designed for his use, to support and maintain his natural life, which would have been continued, had he persisted in his obedience and state of innocence, and very probably by means of this chiefly: hence the son of Sirach calls it the tree of immortality,&quot;The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality.' (Sirach 19:19)and it might be also a sign, token, and symbol to him of his dependence on God; that he received his life from him; and that this was preserved by his blessing and providence, and not by his own power and skill; and that this would be continued, provided he transgressed not the divine law: and it seems to have a further respect, even to eternal life; by Christ; for though it might not be a symbol of that life to Adam in his state of innocence, yet it became so after his fall: hence Christ is sometimes signified by the tree of life, Proverbs 3:18   who is not only the author of natural and spiritual life, but the giver of eternal life; the promise of it is in him, and the blessing itself; he has made way for it by his obedience, sufferings, and death, and is the way unto it; it is in his gift, and he bestows it on all his people, and it will lie greatly in the enjoyment of him. The situation of this tree in the midst of the garden well agrees with him who is in the midst of his church and people, Revelation 1:13   stands open, is in sight, and is accessible to them all now, who may come to him, and partake of the fruits and blessings of his grace, which are many, constant, and durable, Revelation 22:2   and who will be seen and enjoyed by all, to all eternity: </p>
<p> and the tree of knowledge of good and evil ; so called, either with respect to God, who by it tried man, when he had made him, whether he would be good or evil; but this he foreknew: rather therefore with respect to man, not that the eating the fruit of it could really give him such knowledge, nor did he need it; for by the law of nature inscribed on his heart, he knew the difference between good and evil, and that what God commanded was good, and what he forbid was evil: but either it had its name from the virtue Satan ascribed to it, Genesis 3:5   or from the sad event following on man's eating the fruit of it, whereby he became experimentally sensible of the difference between good and evil, between obedience and disobedience to the will of God; he found by sad experience what good he had lost, or might have enjoyed, and what evil he had brought on himself and his posterity, he might have avoided. What this tree was is not certain; there are various conjectures about it, and nothing else can be come at concerning it. Some take it to be the fig tree, as Jarchi, and some in Aben Ezra on Genesis 3:6   because fig leaves were at hand, and immediately made use of on eating the fruit of it; some the vine, and particularly the black grape, as in the book of ZoharF4In Exod. fol. 59. 4. & in Numb. fol. 53. 3. So in Bereshit Rabba, sect. 12. fol. 155. 2. ; others, as Baal Hatturim on Genesis 1:29   the pome citron, or citron apple treeF5Vid. Caphtor Uperah, fol. 49. 1. & 60. 2. & 63. 2. ; others, the common apple, as the author of the old NizzechonF6P. 147. Ed.

<p>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden ,.... Before man was created, as Aben Ezra observes, this river went out of Eden and watered it on every side; but what river is here meant, is hard to say. It is more generally thought to be the river Euphrates, when that and the Tigris met, and became one stream or river, and as such entered and passed through Eden; and as it was parted into four rivers afterwards, in two of which they retained their names: the learned RelandF11Dissert. de Paradiso, p. 53.  thinks, this river is now lost; but the learned writer before referred to thinks, as has been observed, that it is the river Jordan; see note on Genesis  2:8   and which, as PlinyF12Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 15.  says, was a very pleasant river: </p>
<p> and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads ; after it had passed through Eden, and the garden in it, watering it, it divided into four parts or heads of water, or four chief principal rivers, hereafter mentioned; and which circumstance the above writer thinks makes it the more probable to be the river Jordan, which and with the four rivers are spoken of together by the son of Sirach, in the Apocrypha:&quot;25 He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits. 26 He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest. 27 He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage.' (Sirach 24)of which in the following verses. This river may be an emblem of the everlasting love of God, that pure river of water of life, which springs from the throne of God, and of the Lamb, from divine sovereignty, and not from the faith, love, and obedience of man; that river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, and which water the garden, the church, revive its plants, and make it fruitful and delightful; the four heads or branches of which are eternal election of God, particular redemption by Christ, regeneration and sanctification by the Spirit, and eternal life and happiness, as the free gift of God through Christ; see Psalm 46:4 . </p>

So that it seems to be a country in Arabia, near unto, or a part of Cush or Arabia Cusea, and near to Seba or Arabia Felix: and so Strabo, among the nations of the Arabians, and along with the Nabatheans, places the ChaulotaeansF19Ib. p. 528. , who seem to be no other than the posterity of Havilah: according to the learned RelandF20De Paradiso, p. 16, &c. , it is the same with Colchis, a part of Scythia, and Phasis is well known to be a river of Colchis; and which runs into Pontus, as appears from PlinyF21Ut supra. (Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 4. 17.)  and includes Scythia, as JustinF23E Trogo, l. 2. c. 2.  says; and then it must have its name from Havilah, the son of Joktan, Genesis 10:29   and in either of these countries there was gold, and an abundance of it, and of the best, as follows:(After the global destruction of Noah's flood, it is doubtful that the location of these rivers could be determined with any degree of certainty today.

<p>And the gold of that land is good ,.... Arabia was famous for gold: Diodorus SiculusF24Bibliothec. l. 2. p. 133.  speaks of gold in Arabia, called &quot;apyrus&quot;, which is not melted by fire out of small filings, as other; but as soon as dug is said to be pure gold, and that in the size of chestnuts, and of such a flaming colour, that the most precious stones are set in it by artificers for ornament: and in Colchis and Scythia, as StraboF25Geograph. l. 1. p. 31. & l. 11. p. 344.  relates, there are rivers which produce gold; and from whence came the fable of the golden fleece, the Argonauts went to Colchis for: </p>
<p> there is the bdellium, and the onyx stone ; the first of these is either an aromatic gum; the tree, according to PlinyF26Nat. Hist. l. 12. c. 9. , is black, and is of the size of an olive tree, has the leaf of an oak, and its fruit is like capers; it is found in Arabia, India, Media, and Babylon; but the best, according to him, is in Bactriana, and, next to that, the bdellium of Arabia: or else it is a precious stone, and which the Jewish writersF1Jarchi in Numb. xi. 7. David de Pomis Tzemach David, fol. 8. 3.  commonly take to be crystal; and, according to SolinusF2Polyhistor. c. 25. , the best crystal is in Scythia. BochartF3Hierozoic. par. 2. l. 5. c. 5. p. 675, &c.  would have it that the pearl is meant, because of its whiteness and roundness, for which the manna is compared to it, Numbers 11:7   and the rather because of the pearl fishery at Catipha, taking Havilah to be that part of Arabia which lies upon the Persian gulf. The latter, the onyx, is a precious stone, which has its name from its being of the colour of a man's nail; and, according to PlinyF4Nat. Hist. l. 36. c. 7. , the onyx marble is found in the mountains of Arabia, and the ancients thought it was nowhere else; and he speaks elsewhere of the Arabian onyx precious stone, and of the sardonyx, as in the same countryF5lb. l. 37. c. 6. ; and some think that is here meant; though the word is sometimes by the Septuagint rendered the emerald; and the best of these, according to SolinusF6Polyhistor. ut supra.

<p>And the name of the second river is Gihon ,.... There was one of this name in the land of Israel, which, or a branch of it, flowed near Jerusalem, 1 Kings 1:33   this Aben Ezra suggests is here meant, and which favours the notion of the above learned man, that the garden of Eden was in the land of Israel. JosephusF8Antiqu, l. 1. c. 1. sect. 3. Philostorg. Eccl. Hist. l. 3. c. 10. p. 482.  takes it to be the river Nile, as do many others; it seems to have been a branch of the river Euphrates or Tigris, on the eastern side, as Phison was on the west; and so Aben Ezra says it came from the south east. The learned RelandF9De situ Paradisi, p. 32.  will have it to be the river Araxes: it has its name, according to Jarchi, from the force it goes with, and the noise it makes. And it seems to have its name from &#1490;&#1493;&#1495; , which signifies to come forth with great force, as this river is said to do, when it pours itself into the Baltic sea. </p>
<p> The same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia ; either Ethiopia above Egypt; and this favours the notion of those who take Gihon to be the Nile: for PausaniasF11Corinthiaca sive, l. 2. p. 94.  says, that it was commonly reported that the Nile was Euphrates, which disappearing in a marsh, rose up above Ethiopia, and became the Nile, and so washed that country, and is thought to agree very well with the Mosaic account: or else that Cush or Ethiopia, which bordered on Midian, and was a part of Arabia, and may be called Arabia Chusea, often meant by Cush in Scripture. RelandF12Ut supra, (De situ Paradisi) p. 38.  thinks the country of the Cossaeans or Cussaeans, a people bordering on Media, the country of Kuhestan, a province of Persia, is intended.

<p>The name of the third river is Hiddekel ,.... A river which ran by Shushan in Persia, and retained its name in the times of Daniel, Daniel 10:4   where it is called the great river; and it seems it bears the same name now among the Persians; at least it did an hundred and fifty years ago, when RauwolffF13Travels, part. 2. c. 9. p. 159. ed. Ray.  travelled in those parts. The Targum of Jonathan here calls it Diglath, the same with the Diglito of PlinyF14Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 27. ; and according to him it is called Tigris, from its swiftness, either from the tiger, a swift creature, or from &#1490;&#1512;&#1488; , &quot;to dart&quot;, in the Chaldee language; and so CurtiusF15Hist. l. 4. c. 9.  says, that in the Persian language they call a dart &quot;tigris&quot;: and with this agrees the word &quot;Hiddekel&quot;, which in the Hebrew language signifies sharp and swift, as a polished arrow is; and Jarchi says it is so called, because its waters are sharp and swift: though this is contradicted by some modern travellersF16De la Valle & Thevenot, apud Universal History, vol. 4. p. 248.  who say it is a slower stream than the Euphrates, and is not only very crooked, and full of meanders, but also choked up with islands, and great banks of stone: </p>
<p> that is it which goeth towards the east of Assyria : a country which had its name from Ashur, a son of Shem, Genesis 10:11   it became a famous kingdom and monarchy, Nineveh was the metropolis of it, which was built on the river Tigris or Hiddekel; and, as before observed, it ran by Shushan in Persia; and so, as Diodorus SiculusF17Bibliothec. l. 2. p. 99.  says, it passed through Media into Mesopotamia; and which very well agrees with its being, according to Moses, one of the rivers of Eden. Twelve miles up this river, from Mosul, near which Nineveh once stood, lies an island, called the island of Eden, in the heart of the Tigris, about ten English miles in circuit, and is said to be undoubtedly a part of paradiseF18Cartwright's Preacher's Travels, p. 91. : </p>
<p> and the fourth river is Euphrates : or &quot;Phrat&quot;, as in the Hebrew tongue. RelandF19Ut supra, (De Situ Paradisi) p. 45.  seems rightly to judge, that the syllable &quot;eu&quot;, prefixed to it, is the Persian &quot;au&quot; or &quot;cu&quot;, which in that language signifies &quot;water&quot;; so that &quot;Euphrates&quot; is no other than &quot;the water of Phrat&quot;, so called from the fruitfulness of it; for its waters, as Jarchi says, fructify, increase, and fatten the earth; and who rightly observes that these names, and so those of other rivers, and of the countries here mentioned, are named by a prolepsis or anticipation, these being the names they bore when Moses wrote; unless it may be thought to be the Hebrew &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; , &quot;Hu, the, that Phrat&quot;; and which the Greeks have made an &quot;eu&quot; of.

<p>And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden ,.... This is observed before in Genesis 2:8   and is here repeated to introduce what follows; and is to be understood not of a corporeal assumption, by a divine power lifting him up from the place where he was, and carrying him into another; rather of a manuduction, or taking him by the hand and leading him thither; so Onkelos renders it, he &quot;led&quot; him, that is, he ordered and directed him thither: hence Jarchi paraphrases it, he took him with good words, and persuaded him to go thither: the place from whence he is supposed by some to be taken was near Damascus, where he is by them said to be created; or the place where the temple was afterwards built, as say the Jewish writers: the Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;the Lord God took the man from the mount of Service, the place in which he was created, and caused him to dwell in the garden of Eden.'And elsewhereF20Pirke Eliezer, c. 2. fol. 72. 2.  it is said,&quot;the holy blessed God loved the first Adam with an exceeding great love, for he created him out of a pure and holy place; and from what place did he take him? from the place of the house of the sanctuary, and brought him into his palace, as it is said, Genesis 2:15   &quot;and the Lord God took&quot;, &c.'though no more perhaps is intended by this expression, than that God spoke to him or impressed it on his mind, and inclined him to go, or stay there: </p>
<p> to dress it, and to keep it ; so that it seems man was not to live an idle life, in a state of innocence; but this could not be attended with toil and labour, with fatigue and trouble, with sorrow and sweat, as after his fall; but was rather for his recreation and pleasure; though what by nature was left to be improved by art, and what there was for Adam to do, is not easy to say: at present there needed no ploughing, nor sowing, nor planting, nor watering, since God had made every tree pleasant to the sight, good for food, to grow out of it; and a river ran through it to water it: hence in a Jewish tractF21Pirke Eliezer, c. 2. fol. 72. 2. , before referred to, it is said, that his work in the garden was nothing else but to study in the words of the law, and to keep or observe the way of the tree of life: and to this agree the Targums of Jonathan and of Jerusalem,&quot;and he placed him in the garden of Eden, to serve in the law, and keep the commands of it.'And in another tractF23Tikkune Zohar, correct. 54. fol. 91. 2.  it is said,&quot;God brought Adam the law, Job 28:27   and &quot;he put him in the garden of Eden&quot;; that is, the garden of the law, &quot;to dress it&quot;, to do the affirmative precepts of the law, &quot;and to keep it&quot;, the negative precepts:'though Aben Ezra interprets this service of watering the garden, aud keeping wild beasts from entering into it. And indeed the word may be rendered to &quot;till&quot;, as well as to dress, as it is in Genesis 3:23   and by Ainsworth here; so MiltonF24Paradise Lost, B. 8. l. 320.  expresses it; and some have thought Adam was to have planted and sowed, had he continued in the garden. </p>

<p>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ,.... Of the name of this tree, and the reasons of it; see Gill on Genesis 2:9 . </p>
<p> thou shalt not eat of it ; not that this tree had any efficacy in it to increase knowledge, and improve in science and understanding, as Satan suggested God knew; and therefore forbid the eating of it out of envy to man, which the divine Being is capable of; or that there was anything hurtful in it to the bodies of men, if they had eaten of it; or that it was unlawful and evil of itself, if it had not been expressly prohibited: but it was, previous to this injunction, a quite indifferent thing whether man ate of it or not; and therefore was pitched upon as a trial of man's obedience to God, under whose government he was, and whom it was fit he should obey in all things; and since he had a grant of all the trees of the garden but this, it was the greater aggravation of his offence that he should not abstain from it: </p>

Moreover, a spiritual or moral death immediately ensued; he lost his original righteousness, in which he was created; the image of God in him was deformed; the powers and faculties of his soul were corrupted, and he became dead in sins and trespasses; the consequence of which, had it not been for the interposition of a surety and Saviour, who engaged to make satisfaction to law and justice, must have been eternal death, or an everlasting separation from God, to him and all his posterity; for the wages of sin is death, even death eternal, Romans 6:23 . So the JewsF1Tikkune Zohar, correct. 24. fol. 68. 1. correct. 54. fol. 90. 2. correct. 66. fol. 100. 1.  interpret this of death, both in this world and in the world to come. </p>

<p> to see what he would call them ; what names he would give to them; which as it was a trial of the wisdom of man, so a token of his dominion over the creatures, it being an instance of great knowledge of them to give them apt and suitable names, so as to distinguish one from another, and point at something in them that was natural to them, and made them different from each other; for this does not suppose any want of knowledge in God, as if he did this to know what man would do, he knew what names man would give them before he did; but that it might appear he had made one superior to them all in wisdom and power, and for his pleasure, use, and service; and therefore brings them to him, to put them into his hands, and give him authority over them; and being his own, to call them by what names he pleased: </p>
<p> and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof ; it was always afterwards called by it, by him and his posterity, until the confusion of languages, and then every nation called them as they thought proper, everyone in their own language: and as there is a good deal of reason to believe, that the Hebrew language was the first and original language; or however that eastern language, of which the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, are so many dialects; it was this that he spoke, and in it gave names to the creatures suitable to their nature, or agreeable to some property or other observed in them: and BochartF7Hierozoic. par. 1. l. 1. c. 9. p. 59, &c.  has given us many instances of creatures in the Hebrew tongue, whose names answer to some character or another in them: some think this was done by inspiration; and Plato says, that it seemed to him that that nature was superior to human, that gave names to things; and that this was not the work of vain and foolish man, but the first names were appointed by the godsF8In Cratylo, apud Euseb.

<p>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept ,.... This was not a common and natural sleep that Adam fell into, occasioned by any weariness of the animal spirits, in viewing the creatures as they passed by him, and in examining them, and giving them suitable and proper names; but it was supernatural, and from the Lord, his power and providence, who caused it to fall upon him: it was not a drowsiness, nor a slumber, but a sound sleep: his senses were so locked up by it, that he perceived not anything that was done to him; and it seems to have been on purpose, that he might feel no pain, while the operation was made upon him, as well as that it might appear that he had no hand in the formation of the woman; and that he might be the more surprised at the sight of her, just awaking out of sleep, to see so lovely an object, so much like himself, and made out of himself, and in so short a time as while he was taking a comfortable nap: </p>
<p> and he took one of his ribs ; with the flesh along with it: men have commonly, as anatomistsF11Bartholini Anatomia, l. 4. c. 17. p. 516. Vid. Scheuchzer. Physica Sacra, vol. 1. tab. 27. p. 28.  observe, twelve ribs on a side; it seems by this, that Adam had thirteen. The Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;and he took one of his ribs; that is, the thirteenth rib of his right side:'but our English poetF12Who stooping opened my left side, and took From thence a rib.--- Milton's Paradise Lost, B. 8. l. 465.  takes it to be one of the left side, and also a supernumerary oneF13Ib. B. 10. l. 887. . God made an opening in him, and took it out, without putting him to any pain, and without any sensation of it: in what manner this was done we need not inquire; the power of God was sufficient to perform it; Adam was asleep when it was done, and saw it not, and the manner of the operation is not declared: </p>
<p> and closed up the flesh instead thereof : so that there was no opening left, nor any wound made, or a scar appeared, or any loss sustained, but what was made up by an increase of flesh, or by closing up the flesh; and that being hardened like another rib, and so answered the same purpose. (Adam probably had the same number of ribs as we do today. Otherwise the genetic code for creation of an extra rib would cause at least some people today to have thirteen ribs. I know of no such case. Also, we know that acquired characteristics cannot be passed on to the next generation. A man who loses both legs in an accident, usually has children who have two legs.

<p>Therefore shall a man leave his father, and his mother ,.... These are thought by some to be the words of Moses, inferring from the above fact, what ought to be among men; and by others, the words of Adam under divine inspiration, as the father of mankind instructing his sons what to do, and foretelling what would be done in all succeeding ages: though they rather seem to be the words of God himself, by whom marriage was now instituted; and who here gives direction about it, and declares the case and circumstance of man upon it, and how he would and should behave: and thus our Lord Jesus Christ, quoting these words, makes them to be the words of him that made man, male and female, and supplies and prefaces them thus, and said, &quot;for this cause&quot;, &c. Matthew 19:5   so Jarchi paraphrases them,&quot;the Holy Ghost said so:'not that a man upon his marriage is to drop his affections to his parents, or be remiss in his obedience to them, honour of them, and esteem for then, or to neglect the care of them, if they stand in need of his assistance; but that he should depart from his father's house, and no more dwell with him, or bed and board in his house; but having taken a wife to himself, should provide an habitation for him and her to dwell together: so all the three Targums interpret it, of quitting &quot;the house of his father, and his mother's bed&quot;: </p>
<p> and shall cleave unto his wife ; with a cordial affection, taking care of her, nourishing and cherishing her, providing all things comfortable for her, continuing to live with her, and not depart from her as long as they live: the phrase is expressive of the near union by marriage between man and wife; they are, as it were, glued together, and make but one; which is more fully and strongly expressed in the next clause: </p>
<p> and they shall be one flesh ; that is, &quot;they two&quot;, the man and his wife, as it is supplied and interpreted by Christ, Matthew 19:5   and so here in the Targum of Jonathan, and in the Septuagint and Samaritan versions: the union between them is so close, as if they were but one person, one soul, one body; and which is to be observed against polygamy, unlawful divorces, and all uncleanness, fornication, and adultery: only one man and one woman, being joined in lawful wedlock, have a right of copulation with each other, in order to produce a legitimate offspring, partaking of the same one flesh, as children do of their parents, without being able to distinguish the flesh of the one from the other, they partake of: and from hence it appears to be a fabulous notion, that Cecrops, the first king of Athens, was the first institutor of matrimony and joiner of one man to one woman; whence he was said to be &quot;biformis&quot;F16Justin. e Trogo, l. 2. c. 6. , and was called    &#948;&#953;&#966;&#965;&#951;&#962; ; unless, as someF17Vid. Saldeni Otia Theolog. Exercitat. 1. sect. 14. p. 13, 14.  have thought, that he and Moses were one and the same who delivered out the first institution of marriage, which is this. </p>

<p>And they were both naked, the man and his wife ,.... Were as they were created, having no clothes on them, and standing in need of none, to shelter them from the heat or cold, being in a temperate climate; or to conceal any parts of their bodies from the sight of others, there being none of the creatures to guard against on that account: </p>
<p> and were not ashamed ; having nothing in them, or on them, or about them, that caused shame; nothing sinful, defective, scandalous or blameworthy; no sin in their nature, no guilt on their consciences, or wickedness in their hands or actions; and particularly they were not ashamed of their being naked, no more than children are to see each other naked, or we are to behold them: besides, they were not only alone, and none to behold them; but their being naked was no disgrace to them, but was agreeably to their nature; and they were not sensible that there was any necessity or occasion to cover themselves, nor would they have had any, had they continued in their innocent state: moreover, there was not the least reason to be ashamed to appear in such a manner, since they were but one flesh. The Jerusalem Targum is,&quot;they knew not what shame was,'not being conscious of any sin, which sooner or later produces shame. Thus PlatoF18Politico, apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 12. c. 13. p. 588.  describes the first men, who, he says, were produced out of the earth; and for whom the fertile ground and trees brought forth fruit of all kind in abundance of themselves, without any agriculture; that these were    &#947;&#965;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#961;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#953; , &quot;naked and without any covering&quot;; and so Diodories SiculusF19Bibliothec. l. 1. p. 8.  says, the first of men were naked and without clothing. The word here used sometimes signifies wise and cunning; it is rendered &quot;subtle&quot; first verse of the next chapter: and here the Targum of Jonathan is,&quot;they were both wise, Adam and his wife, but they continued not in their glory;'the next thing we hear of is their fall. </p>

<p>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field, which the Lord God had made ,.... Many instances are given of the subtlety of serpents, in hiding their heads when struck at, rolling themselves up, stopping their ear at the voice of the charmer, putting off their skin, lying in sand of the same colour with them, and biting the feet of horses, and other things of the like kind; but by these it does not appear to be now more subtle than any other creature, whatever it might be at its first creation; particularly the fox greatly exceeds it: the words therefore may be rendered, &quot;that serpent&quot;; that particular serpent, of which so much is spoken of afterwards; &quot;or the serpent was become&quot;F20&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;   &quot;factus est&quot;, Schmidt. , or &quot;made more subtle&quot;, that is, not naturally, but through Satan being in it, and using it in a very subtle manner, to answer his purposes, and gain his point: for though a real serpent, and not the mere form or appearance of one, is here meant, as is clear from this account, and the curse afterwards pronounced on it; yet not that only, but as possessed and used by Satan as an instrument of his to accomplish his designs, as is evident from its having the faculty of speech, and the use of reason, employed in a very artful and sophistic manner: nor is it rational to suppose that human nature, in the height of its glory and excellency, should be outwitted and seduced by a creature so inferior to it; besides, the Scriptures always ascribe the seduction of man to the devil; who, because he acted his deceitful part in and by the serpent, is called the serpent, and the old serpent, and the devil and Satan, 2 Corinthians 11:3 . The Targum of Jonathan restrains this subtlety to wickedness, paraphrasing the words&quot;but the serpent was wise to evil.'Some Jewish writersF21Tikkune Zohar, correct. 59. fol. 96. 1.  interpret the passage of the nakedness of the serpent, taking the word in the sense it is used in Genesis 2:25   and render it, &quot;more naked than any beast of the field&quot;, the rest having a clothing, as hair, &c. but this none; and so might be more agreeable to Eve, being in this respect like herself; but it is generally interpreted of subtlety. The serpent early became the object of religions worship. Taautus, or the Egyptian Thoth, was the first that attributed deity to the nature of the dragon, and of serpents; and after him the Egyptians and Phoenicians: the Egyptian god Cneph was a serpent with an hawk's head; and a serpent with the Phoenicians was a good demon: what led them to have such veneration for this animal, were its plenty of spirits, its fiery nature, its swiftness, its various forms it throws itself into, and its long lifeF23Philo Byblius, apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 1. c. 10. p. 41. ; and so PherecydesF24Apud, Euseb. ib.  speaks of a deity of the Phoenicians called Ophioneus; and who also affirmsF25Apud L. Vivem in Aug. de Civ. Dei, l. 4. c. 11. , that this was the prince of demons cast down from heaven by Jupiter; and HerodotusF26Euterpe sive, l. 2. c. 74.  makes mention of sacred serpents about Thebes; and AelianusF1De Animal l. 11. c. 2, 17.  of sacred dragons; and Justin Martyr saysF2Apolog. 2. p. 71. , the serpent with the Heathens was a symbol of all that were reckoned gods by them, and they were painted as such; and wherever serpents were painted, according to PersiusF3&quot;Pinge duos angues pueri, sacer est locus.&quot; Satyr. 1. , it was a plain indication that it was a sacred place. Serpents were sacred to many of the Heathen deities, and who were worshipped either in the form of one, or in a real oneF4See more of this in a Sermon of mine, called The Head of the Serpent bruised, &c. ; all which seem to take their rise from the use the devil made of the serpent in seducing our first parents. </p>
<p> And he said to the woman ; being alone, which he took the advantage of; not the serpent, but Satan in it; just as the angel spoke in Balaam's ass; for we are not to imagine with Philo, Josephus, Aben Ezra, and others, that beasts in their original state had the faculty of speech, and whose language Eve understood: it is very probable that good angels appeared in paradise to our first parents, in one form or another, and conversed with them; it may be in an human form, and it may be in the form of a beautiful flying serpent, which looked very bright and shining, and that sort called Seraph, Numbers 21:6   hence angels may bear the name of Seraphim, as some have thought; so that it might not be at all surprising to Eve to hear the serpent speak, it being what she might have been used to hear, and might take this to be a good angel in such a shape, that was come to bring a message to her from God, and to converse with her for her good, and who thus accosted her: </p>
<p> yea, hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ? or &quot;of any tree&quot;F5&#1502;&#1499;&#1500;  &#1506;&#1509;   &quot;ex ulla arbore&quot;, Piscator. ; so ambiguously does he speak, in order to reproach the divine goodness, and draw into a disbelief of it. The speech is abrupt; and, as Kimchi observesF6Sepher Shoresh in voce &#1488;&#1507; . , supposes some discourse, as to this purpose; surely God hates you, for though you are greater than the rest of the creatures, he has not provided any superior excellency for you, and especially since he has said, &quot;ye shall not eat&quot;, &c. Or as others, taking occasion from their being naked, Genesis 2:25   he observes, that that was unbecoming them, of which they might be ashamed; yea, also, that it was unjust to forbid them to eat of the tree of good and evil: he might, it is suggested, first endeavour to persuade the woman, that it was indecent for her, and her husband, to be naked; which they not being convinced of, he insinuated that this was owing to a defect of knowledge, and that there was a tree in the garden, which if they ate of, would give them that knowledge, and therefore God had forbid it, to keep them in ignorance: but he seems to put this question, to cause them to doubt of it, whether there was such a prohibition or not, and as amazing that it should be, and as not believing it to be true; it being, as he would have it, contrary to the perfections of God, to his goodness and liberality, and to his profession of a peculiar respect to man: wherefore the Targum of Onkelos renders it, &quot;of a truth&quot;, and that of Jonathan, &quot;is it true?&quot; surely it cannot be true, that a God of such goodness could ever deny you such a benefit, or restrain you from such happiness; he can never be your friend that can lay such an injunction on you. </p>

<p>And the woman said unto the serpent ,.... Or to him that spoke in the serpent, which she might take to be a messenger from heaven, a holy angel: had she known who it was, she might be chargeable with imprudence in giving an answer, and carrying on a conversation with him; and yet even supposing this, she might have a good design in her answer; partly to set the matter in a true light, and assert what was truth; and partly to set forth the goodness and liberality of God, in the large provision he had made, and the generous grant he had given them: from this discourse of Eve and the serpent, no doubt PlatoF7In Politico, ut supra, (apud Euseb. Praepar. Evangel. l. 12.) c. 14.  had his notion of the first men discoursing with beasts: </p>
<p> we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden ; of all and every one of them, which is to be understood, excepting the one after mentioned; so far are we from being debarred from eating of any, which the speech of the Serpent might imply, that they were allowed to eat of what they pleased, but one. </p>

<p>But of the fruit of the tree, which is in the midst of the garden ,.... This tree stood near the tree of life, as is highly probable, since that is described in the same situation, Genesis 2:9   she does not give it any name, which perhaps was not as yet given it; or she was not acquainted with it, its name in the preceding chapter being given by anticipation; and most likely it is, it had its name from the event, and as yet was without one: </p>
<p> God hath said, ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die : here the woman is charged by some both with adding to, and taking from the law of God; and if so, must have sinned very heinously before she eat of the fruit; but neither of them are sufficiently proved; not the former by her saying, &quot;neither shall ye touch it&quot;, which though not expressed in the prohibition, is implied, namely, such a touching the fruit as to pluck it off the tree, take it in the hand, and put it to the mouth, in order to eat it: nor the latter by these words, &quot;lest ye die&quot;, or &quot;lest perhaps ye die&quot;F8&#1508;&#1503;   &quot;ne forte&quot;, V. L. Tigurine version, Fagius. ; as if it was a matter of doubt, when it was most strongly assured; for the word used is not always to be understood of doubting, but of the event of a thing; see Psalm 2:12   and may be rendered, &quot;that ye die not&quot;F9   &#953;&#957;&#945; &#956;&#951; &#945;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#949; , Sept. ; which would certainly be the case, should they pluck the fruit and eat of it. </p>

<p> that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened ; not the eyes of their bodies, as if they were now blind, but the eyes of their understanding; meaning, that their knowledge should be enlarged, and they should see things more clearly than they now did, and judge of them in a better manner; yea, even together with the light of their mind, the sight of their bodily eyes would receive some advantage; and particularly, that though they saw the nakedness of their bodies, yet it was as if they saw it not, and were unconcerned about it, and heedless of it; did not see it as unseemly and indecent, and so were not ashamed; but now they should see it as it was, and be filled with shame and confusion: </p>
